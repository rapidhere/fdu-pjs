<BR><BR>BACKGROUND
<BR><BR>This disclosure generally relates to Radio Frequency Identification.
<BR><BR>Radio Frequency Identification ("RFID") may be used to identify, track, and locate--animals, people and assets.  Fundamentally, an RFID system comprises an RFID tag signature device reader ("Reader") and an RFID tag signature device.  These are
also referred to by role as an interrogator and a transponder, respectively.  A Reader may provide functionality beyond that of just reading an RFID tag signature device.  A Reader may transfer data, i.e. write, to an RFID tag signature device as well as
source the energy necessary to power an RFID tag signature device.  When an RFID tag signature device is interrogated by a Reader it may return an analog signal conveying an identification sequence and/or other data.
<BR><BR>There currently exist many different, often proprietary, RFID components, systems, interfaces, and protocols.  Standardization and interoperability are believed necessary to enable wider adoption of this technology. <BR><BR>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF

and/or transforms data represented as physical, electronic and/or magnetic quantities and/or other physical quantities within the computing platform's processors, memories, registers, and/or other information storage, transmission, reception and/or
display devices.  Accordingly, a computing platform refers to a system or a device that includes the ability to process and/or store data in the form of signals.  Thus, a computing platform, in this context, may comprise hardware, software, firmware
and/or any combination thereof.  Where it is described that a user instruct a computing platform to perform a certain action it is understood that instruct may mean to direct or cause to perform a task as a result of a selection or action by a user.  A
user may, for example, may instruct a computing platform to embark upon a course of action by signifying a selection by pushing a key, clicking a mouse, maneuvering a pointer, touching a touch screen, and/or by spoken word.
<BR><BR>FIG. 1 is a block diagram depicting an embodiment of an RFID tag signature-data file composite ("Composite").  Composite 100 may be created by operationally coupling an RFID tag signature with one or more computer files and/or computer file
components.  Operationally coupling files may be accomplished where files that are logically or otherwise linked, joined, referenced, and/or utilized together.  The process of operationally coupling files may produce operationally coupled files.  A
portion of a Composite may comprise an RFID tag signature ("Signature").  A Signature 110 may also be commonly referred to as an RFID transponder response, RFID response signal, RFID answer, RFID music File, or RFID tone to name some, though not all,
common descriptors.  A Signature 110 may be a duplicate or serviceable approximation of a signal returned by an RFID tag signature device in response to an interrogatory signal from a Reader or command from some other computing platform for the RDID tag
signature device to identify itself.  A Signature may be an electromagnetic signal.  A Reader comprises any computing platform capable of functioning as a Reader and/or an RFID Reader/writer.  Signature 100 may for example be captured, saved, created,
emulated, emitted, transmitted, employed, implemented, and/or utilized as an analog signal; or as a digitized approximation of an analog or time varying signal.
<BR><BR>Composite 100 is comprised of Signature 110 and one or more data files.  Data file 120 may, by way of non-limiting example, be comprised of office automation related data, e-commerce related data, and/or media related data.  Office automation
related data includes for example, but is not limited to, data associated with, and/or providing support for, and/or conveying the content of, a word processing, spreadsheet, database, presentation, and/or data entry computer application.  E-commerce
related data includes for example, but is not limited to, data associated with, and/or providing support for, and/or conveying the content of, financial transactions as well as forms data such as purchase and sales orders, for example.  Examples of such
data include purchase data which may be data related to a commercial purchase transaction and sale data which may be data related to a commercial purchase transaction.  Media related data includes for example, but is not limited to, data associated with,
and/or providing support for, and/or conveying the content of, image, sound, and multi-media.  Any of the above listed examples of data file may overlap others and is not intended to be exclusive.  Further, multiple instances of data file 120 may occur
within or be associated with Composite 100.  Any data described above as a "related" of data includes, but is not limited to, data specifically associated with the above-described data but also the related components utilized to implement their creation,
transfer, and use.  Composite 100 may also comprise codec 130 and <B><I>encryption</I></B> 140.  Any of the above described types of related data may comprise a data file of that type.  For example, an office automation related file may be comprised of office

<BR><BR>FIG. 3 is a block diagram depicting an embodiment of a Composite in a networked environment.  More specifically, this embodiment illustrates a way a Composite may be exchanged.  Composite 100 may first be created by outside file origination
source 345, a computing platform, and transmitted to server 340 via download or email for example.  Composite 100 may then be sent from server 340 to a third party device such as a Reader, depicted here as cell phone 335.  Cell phone 335 may have
installed on it a software application adapted to process a Composite.  Such software application may be tailored to particular operating systems and/or devices.  Alternatively, outside file origination source 345 may transmit Composite 100 directly to
computing platform 335.  Similarly, computing platform 335 may originate or modify Composite 100 and transmit it to server 340 and/or outside file origination source 345.
<BR><BR>FIG. 4 is a block diagram depicting installation of an embodiment of a computer software application suitable for operation with a Composite.  A computing platform such as cell phone 400 may have installed within it software application 410
adapted to process a Composite.  If software application 410 is installed while cell phone 400 is still at factory 420 the manufacturer may avail itself of several advantages.  These advantages include, but are not limited to, the ability to load a large
number of similar computing platforms with a tested version of the software application and quality assurance testing of the completed computing platforms.  Similarly, software application 410 may be installed via download 425 or by synchronizing it with
computing platform 430.
<BR><BR>FIG. 5 is a block diagram of an embodiment illustrating transmission of a Composite as an email attachment, and the subsequent storage, then user utilization of the Composite.  Email 500 may be transmitted having Composite 510 as an attachment. 
Computing platform 590, shown here by way of non-limiting example as a PDA, may be capable of processing Composite 510 because it is loaded with software application 550 in a storage medium such as memory 560.  Computing platform 590 may receive and
store email 500 with Composite 510 as an attachment.  Memory 560 may be a storage medium comprised of volatile or non-volatile memory.  Composite 510 may be stored as part of library 520.  Alternatively, Composite 510 may be stored individually or with
other files in folders 530.  User options may be displayed on user screen 595.  If a user initiates "Play Signature" 597 computing platform 590 may transmit the selected Signature through a play assembly such as emitter 570 for example.  The output of
emitter 570 may be received by a capture assembly such as Reader 580 for example or any other computing platform.  Reader 580 may then initiate a subsequent action if appropriate.
<BR><BR>FIG. 6 diagrams an embodiment illustrating a possible user interface for a software application adapted to process a Composite.  Computing platform 600, shown here as a cell phone by way of non-limiting example, contains a software application
running in short-term memory 610.  The software application is adapted to process a Composite.  Long-term memory 620 may be a storage medium that may hold a Composite and/or a library of Composites for use with the aforementioned software application. 
User screen 630 may display application user interface 640.  Application user interface 640 may offer such options as: Get Files; Create Composite; Send Composite; and Save Composite; to list but a few of the many possibilities.
<BR><BR>FIG. 7 is a flow diagram depicting an embodiment of a Composite in the context of a library query.  Utilizing computing platform 700, shown here by way of non-limiting example as a cell phone, a user activates an appropriate user interface
display 710 and logs in to a remote web site 720, here for purposes of example, a registry of deeds website.  From website user interface 725 a user selects a library to download.  From a subsequent website user display 730 the user selects to which type
of computing platform 700 the user wishes the library sent.  This same selection may similarly be made automatically by, for example, the system running the website querying computing platform 700 for its relevant characteristics.  Knowing which type of
device to send the library to will allow registry server 740 to send the library in a format compatible with the operating system and/or other operating characteristics of computing platform 700.  Composites may then be exchanged between computing
platform 700 and the registry website 720.  The user then may be able to locate data and/or files within the registry utilizing Composite searches.  This may include unpacking Composites at the registry and utilizing a Signature to search for information
sought such as specific grantors and grantees within the registry indexes.
<BR><BR>FIG. 8 illustrates an embodiment of a Composite utilized to initiate a purchase transaction with an electronic vendor.  A user operating computing platform 810, shown here by way of non-limiting example as a cell phone, selects from user
interface screen 820 an article for purchase.  Selection of an item may result from user choice while reviewing a website operated by or on behalf of vendor 840.  Similarly, a user may download a library of Composites relevant to the user's interests. 
Upon selecting an item and a vendor a user may instruct computing platform 810 to transmit a Composite to vendor 840.  Vendor 840 may unpack the Composite into a data file specifying the number of units requested and a Signature specifying the particular
product requested.  Vendor 840 may then internally confirm the availability of the item specified by the Signature in the quantity specified by the data component of the Composite.  Vendor 840 may create its own Composite and/or modify the received
Composite to include a photo of the product or other designator such as a stock keeping unit ("SKU") to verify that the potential buyer and seller are thinking of the same item.  Vendor 840 may additionally include within the Composite pricing and
availability information before sending back a new and/or modified Composite to the user on computing platform 810.  Alternatively, vendor 840 may utilize some other File type to communicate with the user on computing platform 810.  User interface screen
820 then may update to display 825 the response from vendor 840.
<BR><BR>Following user screen update 825 the user may elect to continue with the transaction or to end the transaction.  Should the user signal to vendor 840 the user's intent to continue with the transaction vendor 840 may send a subsequent user screen
update 830 asking the user to indicate if the user will pick up the item at a store or wishes the item delivered.  The user may make this decision and then transmit not only this decision but also payment data.  This data, as could any portion of this
transaction, may be encrypted to limit exposing sensitive data to outsiders.  Upon receipt and processing of this information, vendor 840 may transmit confirmation information either as a Composite or in some other form as may be appropriate.  This
confirmation message may then update the user screen 835 conveying to the user that either payment is still due or that payment has been successfully processed by vendor 840.
<BR><BR>FIG. 9 is a block diagram of an embodiment of a purchase pick-up transaction utilizing a Composite.  Here a user has previously arranged for the purchase of an item, for example a desk lamp, utilizing computing platform 810, shown here by way of
non-limiting example as a personal electronic device.  A user visits the store to pick up the item.  At merchandise pick-up window 940 a user may send from computing platform 810 a copy, portion, and/or derivative of a Composite purchase confirmation
previously received and displayed 835 on computing platform 810.  Vendor Reader 930 receives the transmission and may query the vendor's database 950 for the matching transaction data.  Upon locating the proper transaction the in-store register at the
pick-up window may update 945 and signal computing platform 810 that final payment has already been made or is now due, and updating user display 960 to reflect such.  If the user has not previously, the user may then initiate final payment by
instructing computing platform 810 to send a Composite containing a secure authorization to debit the user's financial accounts of the agreed sum.
<BR><BR>FIG. 10 is a flow diagram of an embodiment utilizing a Composite to purchase theater tickets.  A user utilizing computing platform 1000 initiates communication with a network operation center 1010.  The computing platform may be pre-loaded with a
copy of a Signature matching a movie the user wishes to attend.  Alternatively, the user may utilize computing platform 1010 to procure a Signature from another source such as network operation center 1010.  The user may send to network operation center
1010 a Composite containing the Signature and a data component establishing search criteria; such as for example, preferred time to attend, specific theater or area of town to attend movie, and number of tickets desired.  A computer at the network
operation center 1010 may then in turn interrogate a computer at movie theater 1020.  Should movie theater 1020 satisfy the user's criteria it may then notify network operation center 1010 of a match.  Network operation computer 1010 may in turn notify
the user through computing platform 1000 of this result.  Alternatively, movie theater 1020 may contact computing platform 1000 directly regarding this transaction.  Should the user wish to pay for the tickets at this time the user may send a Composite
containing not only any of the previous Composite components but also encrypted payment information.  A Composite from movie theater 1020 confirming successful payment may also serve as an electronic ticket.  Once at movie theater 1020 the user may
instruct computing platform 1000 to transmit the previously received confirmation message to a Reader 1030 and either receive admission or if the user has not previously made payment make payment and then receive admission.
<BR><BR>FIG. 11 is a block diagram depicting the environment and primary data paths for a computing platform adapted to process a Composite.  Computing platform 1100 may send and receive programming to and from a variety of devices in a variety of
manners.  The direction of the arrows in FIG. 11 depict the primary, though not the only, direction of communication.  At factory 1110 computing platform 1100 may have application software installed and tested.  Similarly, application software and/or
updates to application software for computing platform 1100 may be installed by download across the internet, for example Once in use, a user may instruct a computing platform to exchange, that is both send to and receive from, a Composite with server
1130.  Computing platform 1100 may send a Signature to a Reader.  Similarly, computing platform 1100 may receive a Signature from a Reader such as when a Reader reports all tags currently within its range.  Computing platform 1100 can request RFID tag
signature device 1150 for its Signature and then acquire the returned Signature.  Computing platform 1100 may also exchange a Composite, data, and/or a Signature with another computing platform 1160.
<BR><BR>FIG. 12 is illustrative of an embodiment wherein a user may utilize a Composite to locate, order, and pick up a meal.  This embodiment is illustrated where user 1200 is driving around and may decide to order food.  User 1200 utilizes computing
platform 1202, shown here by way of non-limiting example as a PDA, to send a request over user link 1205 to communications center 1250.  In the request, user 1200 asks for the identity of any local fast food restaurants.  Communications center 1260
responds via user link 1205 that Fast Food 1215, Faster Food 1220, and Fastest Food 1225 are nearby to user 1200.  User 1200 selects Fast Food 1215 and requests a menu.  In response, a computing device (not shown) at Fast Food 1215 sends to user's PDA
1202 a menu comprising a library of Composites.  User 1200 opens the library and makes food selections and then communicates these selections to Fast Food 1215.  Workers at Fast Food 1215 pick the selected items from inventory and place them in bag 1230. Bag 1230 may include RFID tag 1235.  A worker may scan RFID tag 1235 for its Signature.  A Composite is then transmitted to user's PDA 1202 including within the Composite the Signature specific to bag 1230.  Upon receipt of the Composite user 1200 may or
may not make payment.  Arriving at Fast Food 1215 user 1200 may transmit from user PDA 1202 the Composite including the Signature associated with RFID tag 1235 thus identifying bag 1230 as containing user 1200's order.  Should user 1200 not previously
have made payment user 1200 may now do so.  Payment may comprise transmitting an additional Composite.
<BR><BR>FIG. 13 illustrates a situation where a user downloads a library of Composites, travels to a remote office, and utilizes a Composite to locate a specific paper file.  User 1300, shown here by way of non-limiting example as an attorney, may learn
that she is to travel to a remote office where she is unfamiliar with the filing system.  In preparation user 1300 downloads from her home-office system 1310 to her user device 1305, shown here by way of non-limiting example as a personal electronic
device (PED), a library of Composites.  She then travels by plane 1315 to the remote office.  She may then decide to physically locate a particular paper file stored somewhere on shelves 1320 among other files 1325.  User 1300 identifies the file of
interest on user device 1305 by reading a visual rendering of the data file component of a Composite.  She may then cause user device 1305 to transmit the Signature associated with the selected Composite and its related paper file.  Upon receipt of the
Signature, Reader 1330, located within the sought after file, may blink a light and/or sound a buzzer to indicate the precise location of the file.
<BR><BR>FIG. 14 depicts an embodiment of an RFID tag signature repeater system.  System 1400 may be comprised of an RFID tag signature device 1410 and repeater device 1420 which may be a computing platform.  A user, not shown, may cause repeater device
1420 to interrogate RFID tag signature device 1410 for its Signature.  Repeater device 1420 may be an analog and/or digital device.  Upon receipt of the Signature, repeater device 1420 may forward the Signature to another computing device for matching to
a descriptor of the tagged item.  Additionally, repeater device 1420 may process the Signature by, for instance, digitizing the Signature before forwarding it to a computing platform where it may be either matched as above or even forwarded again.  A
Signature is emitted by an RFID tag signature device in its raw, i.e. native, format.  Digitizing a Signature may involve receiving a Signature in analog form and converting it into a digital signal for use in a computer by representing the original
analog signal in digital form.  An example of a computing device that may perform this conversion includes an analog-to-digital converter.  Digitizing an RFID tag signature may not necessarily include decoding an RFID tag signature into alpha/numeric
code so that it may be readable by a human.  Examples of computing platforms that may serve as repeaters or be adapted to serve as repeaters include, but are not limited to, a cell phone, PDA, any manner of personal electronic and/or entertainment device
(PED), and or a variety of commercial devices including, but not limited to, dedicated and multi-function electronics.  A repeater may be a device that receives, amplifies, and retransmits a signal.  A repeater may utilize a capture assembly to receive a
signal and a play assembly to send a signal.  A repeater may also store a signal.  The operation of a repeater may include reshaping or retiming a received signal.  Retransmitting a signal may include forwarding a signal.  A repeater may amplify a signal
regardless of the nature of the signal.
<BR><BR>Capture and play assemblies may capture and/or play signals at or near a wide variety of frequency bands.  These may include, but are not limited to, the ranges described below.  For example, low frequency signals may be utilized at a frequency
including and between 80-750 kHz such as may be employed in access and inventory control applications, for example.  Intermediate frequency signals may be utilized at a frequency including and between 10-15 MHz such as may be employed in access control
and smart card applications, for example.  High frequency signals may be utilized at a frequency including and between 750-985 MHz and/or 1.0-9.8 GHz such as may be employed in transportation applications, for example.  These frequencies are described
for illustrative purposes and accordingly are not limiting.
<BR><BR>FIG. 15 depicts a repeater device coupled to a computing platform.  One aspect of this drawing provides a cut-away view of repeater device 1420.  Repeater device 1420 may comprise processor 1530, memory 1620, and digitizer 1540.  Processor 1530
may comprise a microprocessor, signal processor, microcontroller, dedicated processor, custom processor, application specific processor, field programmable processor to name some, though not all, contemplated devices and accordingly is not limited in
these respects.  Memory 1520 may be a storage medium comprised of long and/or short term memory either in the form of integrated computer circuits such as RAM or EEPROM for example and/or storage device of another configuration such as a disk drive for
example.  Digitizer 1540 may provide the functionality described above in the discussion of digitizing a Signature.  Repeater device 1420 may communicate with computing platform 1550 for example via wireless, wired, or contact based communication. 
Wireless communication may include such through-the-air communications as may be commonly utilized in WiFi, cellular, other broadcast techniques, and technologies.  Wired communications may be effectuated, by way of non-limiting example, via twisted
pair, Ethernet, copper cable, and/or fiber optic cable.  Contact based communication may include where a repeater is swiped through a reader as commonly performed with a credit card, and/or brought in to contact with a computing device such as for
example by being placed into a cradle.  Computing platform 1550 may comprise a server, router, and/or a virtual machine such as that which may support a distributed database for example.
<BR><BR>FIG. 16 is a flow diagram illustrating a method of identifying an RFID tagged item without decoding a Signature.  The method 1600 is illustrated as a series of operations and selections which may or may not be performed in the order indicated
and/or some may not even be performed at all.  The method begins at start 1610.  First, the method may perform a read of Signature 1620.  Following this, a decision whether or not to digitize 1630 the Signature may be made.  A "yes" decision may cause
the signal be sent to digitize 1640.  In contrast, a "no" decision" may bypass digitize 1640.  At match 1650 the Signature may then be matched to a descriptor relevant to the RFID tag signature device of interest.  Following this the method is completed
and comes to end 1660.
