<P>Mechanisms and techniques provide for authenticating devices in a network
     such as a <B><I>Radio Frequency Identification (RFID</I></B>) Network between control
     stations and one or more transceivers. A transceiver receives transceiver
     configuration information including a network address and transceiver
     authentication credentials and receives an authentication request from
     the control station. The transceiver applies authentication processing to
     request information within the authentication request in conjunction with
     the transceiver authentication credentials to produce an authentication
     response and transmits the authentication response to the control station
     to allow the control station to determine if the transceiver is
     authorized to communicate within the remote identification system.

<BR><BR>Conventional wireless computer and communication networking environments include computerized devices equipped with wireless communications circuitry that enables wireless (e.g., radio frequency) communications to take place between the devices
operating in the network.  One example of such a conventional wireless network is a radio frequency identification (RFID) network or system that enables communication with objects that contain or have radio frequency identification tags affixed thereto.
<BR><BR>In a typical configuration of a conventional RFID network, a central control computer system communicates with a group of transceiver devices known as "tag readers" that are distributed or installed for operation over a particular geographical
coverage area or zone.  Each tag reader is able to broadcast a radio frequency signal according to a specific tag communications protocol that causes the individual radio frequency tags affixed to objects in the zone of that tag reader to respond with
information such as a unique tag identity programmed into each tag.  In this way, the tag reader can detect the unique tag identities of all tagged objects within that tag reader's "readable" zone and can report this information back to the central
computer system.  This allows the central computer system to identify and track the existence of specific tagged objects within the zone of each transceiver within the RFID system.
<BR><BR>As a specific example, in a retail setting, an aisle in a store may contain items of merchandise for sale that each contains an attached RFID tag that is encoded with a unique identification code.  The central computer system may periodically
activate a tag reader positioned in a location nearby the aisle to cause the tag reader to send out a radio frequency signal having a special modulated encoding that causes the tagged items of merchandise in the store to report their identity or other
information to the tag reader via activation of circuitry within each tag in response to the signal from the tag reader.  The tag reader collects the reported identities of the tagged merchandise and returns this information to the central control
computer system for inventory control and sales tracking purposes.  RFID network equipment manufacturers and developers are presently deploying RFID networks in a variety of operational environments such as manufacturing, shipping and retail settings to
provide a mechanism for tracking large numbers of tagged objects.
<BR><BR>Early implementations of RFID networks provided for hard-wired or physical communications links such as data communications cables extending from the central computer system to each transceiver (i.e., each tag reader was physically coupled with a
communications link to the central computer system).  However, more recent developments in RFID technology resulting difficulties in dealing with geographic complexities of operating environments of RFID networks have resulted in the ability of tag
readers to communicate wirelessly with the central control computer system.  This allows the tag readers to be placed in convenient locations throughout the geographic region of coverage desired for the RFID network and avoids constraints imposed by any
requirement to provide physical data communications cable paths to the tag readers.  In addition, in situations in which an RFID network needs to be expanded to additional geographic regions or zones, wireless communications between the tag readers and
the central control computer system enables quick network expansion capability by simply adding additional tag readers at locations requiring RFID coverage without wiring a data communications link from the central computer system to those zones.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY
<BR><BR>Conventional wireless communications networks suffer from a variety of deficiencies related to security and authentication between wireless transceiver devices such as RFID tag readers and a central computer system operating in such networks.  As
an example, conventional RFID networks do not provide robust and dynamically changing security mechanisms that support authentication between transceivers (i.e., tag readers) and the central control computer system used in such networks prior to allowing
the tag readers to operate in such networks.  Due to the lack of a robust and adaptable authentication mechanism between transceivers and the central control computer system, conventional wireless and RFID networks are susceptible to malicious or
fraudulent attacks in which an individual substitutes an existing wireless transceiver such as a RFID tag reader with a compromised transceiver that has been intentionally modified to report fraudulent or altered tagged object information within the RFID
network.
<BR><BR>As an example, consider the RFID network used in the retail setting briefly discussed above.  If the tag readers operate using wireless communications mechanisms and are distributed throughout a store in order to track merchandise information, an
individual with malicious intent could enter the store with a new maliciously configured transceiver tag reader and could substitute an existing wireless transceiver with this new transceiver could be modified to spoof the central control computer system
by reporting incorrect tagged object activity (e.g., movement) or tag identity information.  Such unauthorized RFID transceivers could, for example, establish themselves as part of the local RFID geographical network and send spurious data to the central
controlling computer system or to other devices in such a network.  As another example, an unauthorized RFID transceiver might be able to "sniff" or listen to network traffic and thereafter masquerade as another device within the network in order to
interfere with or provide fraudulent tagged object information within the network.
<BR><BR>Conventional wireless networks offer some conventional security mechanisms such certificates or key-based <B><I>encryption</I></B> protocols that operate between a base station (e.g. a central controller) and wireless devices (e.g., 802.11 wireless
transceivers).  However, such conventional security protocols such as the Wireless <B><I>Encryption</I></B> Protocol (WEP) and/or certificates do not dynamically change in real-time.  In other words, once a conventional wireless device is configured with a key for use
in WEP or a certificate or a digital signature, this information does not change within the device in a dynamic manner during use of the authentication mechanism.  Accordingly, conventional key or certificate-based data <B><I>encryption</I></B> and authentication
algorithms do not provide the ability to modify data (e.g., key or certificate data) used during the protocol to provide or impose dynamic modified operation in real-time.  Moreover, in specific network environments such as RFID networks, there are no
conventional mechanisms in place that operate between a base station or central control computer system to provide mechanisms to check the authenticity of a wireless transceiver tag reader operating in an RFID network and to disallow participation of
unauthorized transceivers in the network environment since such systems do not provide proper authentication and/or authorization mechanisms for such transceivers prior to allowing them to operate within the RFID network.
<BR><BR>Embodiments of the invention significantly overcome such drawbacks and deficiencies of conventional wireless communication authentication systems by providing dynamically changeable mechanisms and techniques to distinguish between authorized and
unauthorized transceivers (e.g., tag readers) in a communications network such as an RFID network.  In particular, embodiments of the invention provide a mechanism to allow a computer system such as the central control computer system or base station in
an RFID network to perform a challenge/response protocol as defined herein to properly authenticate and authorize operation of transceiver tag readers within the network.  Communications provided from transceivers within the network that cannot be
authenticated according to the challenge/response protocol are ignored.  In this manner, embodiments of the invention provide a robust and dynamically changeable mechanism for communications devices used in networks such as RFID networks to avoid
problems such as the placement of a compromised or unauthorized transceiver within the network for disruption of proper network operation.
<BR><BR>More specifically, embodiments of the invention provide mechanisms and techniques for authenticating operation of the transceiver with a control station within a wireless remote identification system such as an RFID network.  Embodiments of the
invention operate within a central control station and within one or more transceivers such as tag readers placed within the network.  Within a transceiver equipped with an embodiment of the invention, the transceiver operates to receive transceiver
configuration information including a network address and transceiver authentication credentials.
<BR><BR>The network address may be, for example, a Machine Access Code (MAC) address as well as an Internet Protocol (IP) network address assigned to the transceiver by a Dynamic Host Control Protocol (DHCP) process or other address assignment process
operating within the control station or within a separate DHCP or address assignment server.  In one embodiment, assignment of the IP address to the transceiver is only allowed and performed if a Machine Access Control (MAC) address of the transceiver
has been pre-configured into the DHCP server in the network.  In such an embodiment, when the transceiver is activated (i.e., is turned on or appears to be attempting communications for request of an address) within the network and provides a request to
the DHCP server for an assigned network address, the DHCP server checks to see if the MAC address contained in the address request from that transceiver has been registered with the DHCP or other address server.  If a network administrator has properly
registered the MAC address of the requesting transceiver with the DHCP server, the DHCP server responds with a valid IP address for use by that transceiver within the network.  Otherwise, the DHCP server can send an alarm to transceiver management
software in the central control computer system indicating that an unauthorized transceiver device is trying to intrude and operate within the RFID network.
<BR><BR>In one embodiment, receipt of the transceiver authentication credentials includes receiving a transceiver identification code (e.g., an Electronic Product Code or EPC code) that is uniquely assigned to that specific transceiver, and further
includes receiving a transceiver instruction set containing a set of authentication values and corresponding authentication instructions.  The authentication values may be, for example, a set of strings of alphanumeric characters randomly generated
within the control station.  For each alphanumeric character string, the authentication credentials can include a corresponding authentication instruction that maybe, for example, a logic instruction such as AND, OR, XOR, NOR, NAND, a shift operation
(e.g., right shift or left shift) or an instruction set modification operation such as an instruction to "roll" the instruction set forward or backward.
<BR><BR>Depending upon the embodiment of the invention, these authentication credentials (string and logic instruction pairs) are configured manually (e.g., via a network operator during the first installation of the transceiver into the network) or
automatically (e.g., via automatic download during a trusted time period) into the transceiver prior to installation within the network.  In addition, in one embodiment of the invention the transceiver operates to periodically receive replacement
transceiver authentication credentials to replace the transceiver authentication credentials currently configured into the device such that the operations of authenticating the transceiver using the credentials will be different each time it is performed
with a different replacement set of transceiver authentication credentials.  As will be explained, the authentication credentials allow the system of the invention to determine if the transceiver is a properly authorized transceiver to communicate within
the network.  Furthermore, since the credentials are dynamically modifiable and updateable, the authentication processing of the system of the invention can dynamically change and account for situations in which a malicious individual somehow obtains or
gets possession of a set of currently acceptable credentials and programs a compromised transceiver with such information to allow this compromised transceiver to operate on the network.  By periodic replacement of credentials in an automated manner, the
compromised transceiver will no longer be able to use the old credentials for proper operation in the network.
<BR><BR>Once configured, the transceiver configured according to embodiments of the invention receives an authentication request from a control station within the remote identification system.  In one embodiment, the request information within the
authentication request includes a request authentication result and a request data value.  The request authentication result in one configuration is a hash value result produced from a hash function within the control station.  The control station
performs this hash function on a selected one of the alphanumeric character strings within an equivalent set of authentication credentials maintained by the control station on behalf of the transceiver being authenticated.  In other words, the
authentication request from the control station in one embodiment of the invention provides a hash value that the control station calculates on a randomly selected alphanumeric character string within the set of authentication credentials associated with
this transceiver.  The request data value in the authentication request is used during application of a selected logic instruction within the transceiver, as will be explained.
<BR><BR>Upon receiving the authentication request from the control station, the transceiver applies authentication processing to request information within the authentication request in conjunction with the transceiver authentication credentials to
produce an authentication response.  In particular, in one embodiment of the invention this involves the transceiver being able to identify an authentication instruction that matches the request authentication result and applying the authentication
instruction that matches the request authentication result to the request data value from the authentication request to produce the authentication response.  In particular, in one embodiment, for the transceiver to properly identify an authentication
instruction that matches the request authentication result, the transceiver applies an authentication function (e.g., a hash function, equivalent to the one applied by the control station) to authentication values (e.g., to the set of alphanumeric string
values) in the set of authentication values within the transceiver authentication credentials to produce corresponding transceiver authentication results (e.g., a resulting set of hash values).  For each transceiver authentication result produced, the
transceiver determines if the transceiver authentication result (i.e., its own hash value) matches the request authentication result (i.e., the hash value produced by and received from the central control station) for that authentication value.  That is,
in one embodiment the authentication function is an equivalent hash function within the transceiver (i.e., is the same hash function as used by the control station) and the request authentication result is calculated by the control station using the hash
function on a copy of the authentication values in the set of authentication values within the transceiver authentication credentials that is programmed into the control station.  If the transceiver authentication result matches the request
authentication result for that authentication value, the transceiver has found the matching authentication instruction or function and performs the operation applying that authentication instruction to produce the authentication response.
<BR><BR>In this manner, when the authentication request containing a hash value from the control station is received by the transceiver, the transceiver can compute its own hash value on authentication values in its credentials and can compare this
computed hash value to hash value received from the control station.  If a match is detected, the authentication instruction corresponding to matching hashed authentication value is then applied to the request data value to produce the authentication
response value.  Only if the control station and the transceiver are configured with equivalent authentication credential information will an authentication response value be acceptable to the control station.  In one embodiment of the invention the
authentication instruction, such as one of the logic instructions listed above, is applied to the request data value received from the control station in conjunction with the transceiver identification code (e.g., the EPC code assigned to this
transceiver) to obtain the authentication response.
<BR><BR>After performing this processing, the transceiver transmits the authentication response to the control station to allow the control station to determine if the transceiver is authorized to communicate within the remote identification system.  In
this manner, embodiments of the invention operate to provide a challenge and response protocol between the central control station in the transceiver operate within a network such as and horrified the network to allow the control station to authenticate
each transceiver and allow its operation within the network.  This processing can be periodically repeated between the control station and one or more transceivers any number of times in order to initially confirm and accept the transceiver onto the
network.  In addition, the system of the invention can perform this processing periodically at random or scheduled intervals in order to continually authenticate the proper operation of the transceiver within the network.  This allows embodiments of the
invention to detect a situation, for example, when an authorized transceiver's identity is hijacked and the authorized transceiver is replaced within an unauthorized transceiver.  Since the system of the invention allows periodic replacement of the
credentials within the transceiver, a compromised transceiver can be detected after a short period of time depending upon the replacement interval and depending upon how frequently the authentication processing is performed.

readers) 120-1 through 120-N in accordance with an example embodiment of the invention.  Each control station 110-1 through 110-P may be, for example, a personal computer system, workstation or other type of computer system or computerized device that
operates a transceiver manager 151.  The transceiver manager 151 is, in this example, an RFID network management control program (e.g., a software application) that operates to communicate with the transceivers 120 to perform RFID network processing
within the transceiver network 105.  The transceiver network 105 may be a wireless communications medium or, alternatively, may be a physical communications medium such as a data communications cable.  A network manager 101 (e.g., a person responsible
for managing the network 100) interacts with the control station 110 (and can also interact with the transceivers 120, such as for installation purposes, if required).
<BR><BR>Generally, the transceiver manager 151 within the control station 110 is able to control the transceivers 120 in order to cause each transceiver 120 to communicate with a set of tagged items 130-1 through 130-M to communicate with and collect the
identity of those tagged items 130 readable (i.e., within the geographic vicinity) by each transceiver 120.  The transceiver manager 151 within the control station 110 includes a transceiver authenticator 150 configured to operate in accordance with
embodiments of the invention to allow the control station to authenticate each transceiver 120.  The transceiver authenticator 150 operates in conjunction a transceiver database 152 containing sets of authentication credentials 170-1 through 170-N (one
for each transceiver 120 in this example) accessible to the control station 110 (e.g., configured into memory, persistent storage or available from the remote source) to perform the authentication processing explained herein.  The transceiver database
152 in this example embodiment also contains a set of network address information 190 that contains, for example, the set of allowable Machine Access Control (MAC) addresses of each transceiver 120 that will be allowed to perform communications with the
control station 110 concerning tagged item information, along with corresponding assigned IP addresses provided transceivers 120.
<BR><BR>Each transceiver 120 operates an authentication process 160 (e.g., a software program encoded within firmware, a microcontroller, circuitry or other processing mechanism) that communicates with the transceiver authenticator 150 in the control
station 110 in order to provide the authentication mechanisms and perform the processing techniques as explained herein.  Each transceiver 120-1 through 120-N in this example is further configured with a respective set of authentication credentials 170-1
through 17-N and a respective network address 180-1 through 180-N. The set of authentication credentials 170 maintained with a transceiver 120 is also maintained as a corresponding set of authentication credentials 170 within the control station 110.  If
each transceiver 120 has a different set of credentials 170, then the central control station 110 maintains a copy of each different set of credentials 170.
<BR><BR>It is to be understood that in alternative configurations of the invention, each transceiver 120-1 through 120-N may be configured with a common (e.g., universal or the same) set of authentication credentials 170 and the control station 110 can
use this common set of authentication credentials 170 for each of the separate transceivers 120 such that the authentication credentials 170 for one transceiver are the same as the authentication credentials for another transceiver 120.  The example
illustrated FIG. 1 however uses a distinct set of authentication credentials 170 for each transceiver 120 to provide additional security.
<BR><BR>To perform the authentication processing explained herein, the control station 110 and the transceivers 120 exchange a series of authentication messages (as will be explained) to allow the transceiver authenticator 150 operating within the
control station 110 to determine if a particular transceiver 120 should be allowed to communicate within the transceiver network 105 (i.e., should be allowed report information concerning tagged items 130 to the control station 110 for processing by the
transceiver manager application 151).  The particular processing operations resulting in the creation of the authentication messages exchanged between control station 110 and the transceivers 120 will now be explained with respect to the flowchart of
processing steps illustrated in FIGS. 2 through 4.
<BR><BR>FIGS. 2, 3 and 4 are a single flowchart of processing steps performed by (e.g., between) the control station 110 configured with the transceiver manager 151 and a transceiver 120 configured with the authentication process 160 in accordance with
embodiments of the invention.  This flow chart of processing steps allows the control station 110 to authenticate the transceiver 120 and allows that transceiver 120 to communicate regarding tagged item information on the transceiver network.  Since
embodiments of the invention involve significant back and forth (e.g., handshaking) exchanges between the control station 110 and the transceiver 120, some steps in the flow chart indicate processing operations performed by the control station 110 (e.g.,
by the transceiver manager 151 and/or transceiver authenticator 150), while other steps indicate processing operations performed by the transceiver 120 (e.g., by the authentication process 160).  The devices performing the indicated processing for each
step will be clearly identified during the discussion of the processing.
<BR><BR>In step 200, the control station 110 receives transceiver configuration information for each transceiver 120 including a network address (e.g., a MAC address) and transceiver authentication credentials.  This processing step represents an
installation and network configuration stage in which the control station 110 is configured (e.g., via the network administrator 101) with a set of allowable MAC addresses for transceivers that will be operating within the remote identification system or
network 100.  As an example, if there are five transceivers 120, the network manager 101 can configure the control station 110 with the MAC address information of each transceiver as obtained from the manufacturer of that transceiver (or from firmware in
the transceiver).  The network administrator 101 can also program or load the initial set of authentication credentials 170 into the transceiver 120 as well.  As will be explained shortly, the sets of transceiver authentication credentials 170-1 through
170-N can either be manually configured (e.g., by the network manager 101) or may be periodically automatically generated by the transceiver manager 151 and uploaded into the transceiver 120.  Thus this configuration process can be fully or partially
automated to require little or no assistance form the network manager 101.  Details of transceiver configuration in step 200 are shown in sub-steps 201 through 204.  As indicated in the flow chart, steps nested within steps (e.g., step boxes within a
step box) generally indicate sub-steps or processing operations involved to perform all or a portion of the processing of the outer box, step or operation.
<BR><BR>In step 201 a transceiver 120 appears on the network (e.g., is powered on and begins to attempt to communicate with the control station 110).
<BR><BR>In step 202, the transceiver 120 requests (via address request 111) and receives (via address response 112) transceiver configuration information including a network address (e.g., an IP address) and a set of transceiver authentication
credentials 170 respectively assigned to the transceiver 120.  Details of step 202 are shown in sub-steps 203 and 204.
<BR><BR>In step sub-203, the transceiver 120 performs address assignment processing to receive the network address 180 for the transceiver 120 to use to communicate on the transceiver network 105.  The address assignment processing can include, for
example, the transceiver 120 providing its initially configured MAC hardware address in the address request 111 to the transceiver manager 151 for comparison against a set of allowed MAC addresses maintained by the control station 110 in the network
addresses information database 190 (within the transceiver database 152).  If the transceiver's MAC address is contained in the network address information 190, the transceiver manager 151 operating in the control station 110 can perform DHCP
functionality to assign, via the address response 112, an IP address to the requesting transceiver 120.  Note that this exchange 111, 112 provides an additional level of security by only assigning IP addresses the transceivers 120 that have known MAC
addresses.
<BR><BR>Next, in step 204, the transceiver 120 receives transceiver authentication credentials including receiving a transceiver identification code uniquely assigned to the transceiver and a transceiver instruction set containing a set of authentication
values and corresponding authentication instructions.  This processing can be done automatically by having the transceiver manager 151, in response to a credential request 113 from the transceiver 110, download, via a credential response 114, the
appropriate transceiver identification code such as an Electronic Product Code (EPC code or other unique identity) and the transceiver instruction set to the transceiver 120 once its network IP address has been assigned.  Automated configuration of the
authentication credentials 170 into a transceiver 120 via a request and response sequence 113, 114 allows the system of the invention to cause each transceiver 120 to periodically receive replacement transceiver authentication credentials 170 to replace
the transceiver authentication credentials presently configured transceiver 120 further provided in additional level of security in the event that a set of authentication credentials 170 are compromised during operation of the system.  Alternatively, the
network administrator 101 can program the credentials via input 143 into the transceiver 120 in a secure manner.
<BR><BR>A transceiver instruction set within the set of authentication credentials 170 for a transceiver 120 in accordance with one example embodied in the invention is shown in the table below:
<BR><BR> TABLE-US-00001 TABLE 1 Example Instruction Set for Transceiver 120.  Authentication Authentication Value 171 Instruction 173 DJHGKLSHJGFKLR12BJ AND FVHJKSHGV987K398H0 OR FHGSUHFSGHILDJHH43 XOR KFJGHLIGHDVJHSGJDJ NOR FSJGFDKJHDFDKHDLK NAND

<BR><BR>In the example instruction set shown above, the authentication values 171 (column 1) may be, for example, a set of strings of alphanumeric characters randomly generated by the transceiver manager 151.  For each alphanumeric character string 171
(i.e., each row), the authentication credentials 170 can include a corresponding authentication instruction 173 (Column 3) that may be, for example, a logic instruction such as AND, OR, XOR, NOR, NAND, a shift operation (e.g., right shift or left shift)
or an instruction set modification operation such as an instruction to roll the instruction set forward or backward (Fwd.  Roll Inst.  Set, Bwd.  Roll Inst.  Set).  Column 2 will be used to contain transceiver authentication results 172 that the
authentication processor 160 in the transceiver 120 calculates, as will be explained, by application of an authentication function such as a hash function to the authentication values 171 in Column 1 during processing of embodiments of the invention.
<BR><BR>Note that the transceiver authentication results 172 in Column 2 are not provided to the transceiver 120 by the control station 110 within the set of authentication credentials 170 but rather, are calculated by the authentication processor 160 in
the transceiver by application of a hash function or other authentication function during authentication processing between the control station 110 in the transceiver 120.
<BR><BR>Depending upon the embodiment of the invention, Column 1 and 3 (171, 173) of these authentication credentials 170 can be either configured manually (e.g., by the network manager 101 via path 116) or automatically (e.g., via periodic download via
credential requests 113 and credential responses 114) into the transceiver 120 prior to installation (i.e., prior to operation) within the network 100.  As will be explained, the authentication credentials in Table 1 above allow the system of the
invention to determine if the transceiver 120 is a properly authorized transceiver to communicate within the network 100.  Once the transceiver 120 is configured with the authentication credentials including the authentication values 171 in column 1 and
authentication instruction 173 in Column 3, the transceiver 120 is able to begin authentication processing to validate its authenticity to the control station 110.
<BR><BR>In step 205 the transceiver 120 receives an authentication request 140 from the control station 110 within the wireless remote identification system 100.  The authentication request 140 includes request information including a request
authentication result 141 and a request data value 142.  An example of an authentication request 140 transmitted from control station 110 to the transceiver 120 can appear as follows: (Request Authentication Result 141, Request Data Value 142) Example
Authentication Request 140.
<BR><BR>Within the above example authentication request 140, the request authentication result 141 in one configuration is a hash value result produced from a hash function 175 within the control station that the transceiver manager 151 performs on a
selected authentication value 171 (e.g., on a selected alphanumeric character string) in Column 1 in set of authentication credentials 170 maintained by the control station 110 on behalf of this transceiver 120.  In other words, the authentication
request 140 from the control station 110 in one embodiment of the invention provides a hash value 141 that the control station 110 (i.e., the transceiver manager 150) calculates (using a hash authentication function 175) on a selected alphanumeric
character string 171 in Column 1 (e.g., that is randomly selected) within the instruction set of the authentication credentials 170 associated with the transceiver 120 being authenticated.  The transceiver 120 can use this hash value 141 to determine if
it matches a hash value that the transceiver 120 itself calculates (in Column 2 below) on one of the authentication values 171 in Table 1 above, as will be explained in detail next.
<BR><BR>In step 206 the transceiver 120 applies authentication processing to the request information (e.g., to the request authentication result 141 and request data value 142) within the authentication request 140 (received form the control station 110)
in conjunction with the transceiver authentication credentials 170 to produce an authentication response 142.  The processing sub-steps involved to process the authentication request 140 are explained next.
<BR><BR>In step 207, the authentication processor 160 operating in the transceiver 120 identifies an authentication instruction 173 (Column 3) that matches the request authentication result 141 received from control station 110 within the authentication
request 140.
<BR><BR>To do so, in step 208, the authentication process 160 in the transceiver 120 applies an authentication function 175 to authentication values 171 in Column 1 of Table 1 above within the transceiver authentication credentials 170 to produce
corresponding transceiver authentication results 172 as shown in Column 2 below:
<BR><BR> TABLE-US-00002 TABLE 2 Example Instruction Set including calculated Transceiver Authentication Result (Column 2) for a Transceiver 120.  Transceiver Authentication Result Authentication Authentication Value 171 172 Instruction 173

<BR><BR>In one embodiment, the request authentication result 141 (obtained form the control station 110) is a hash value result produced from a hash function 175 within the control station 110 on a selected authentication value 171 from Column 1 (done
using the corresponding authentication set 170 maintained by the control station 110) and the authentication function 175 performed by the authentication process 160 in the transceiver 120 provides an equivalent hash function and computes the transceiver
authentication result values 172 in Column 2 upon receipt of an incoming authentication request 140.
<BR><BR>In step 209, for each transceiver authentication result 172 (Column 2 in Table 1) that is produced in step 208, the authentication process 160 determines if the transceiver authentication result 172 (value in Column 2) matches the request
authentication result 141 for that authentication value 171.  If the transceiver authentication result 172 computed based on the authentication value 171 matches the request authentication result 141 calculated by the control station 110, the a matching
instruction 173 has been identified and processing proceeds to step 210 to perform the operation applying the authentication logic instruction 173 to produce the authentication response 144.  Note that if no hash value 172 that the authentication process
160 computes on any authentication result 171 matches the received request authentication result 141, then processing is complete and no authentication response 142 is returned and the transceiver is unable to authenticate itself.
<BR><BR>In step 210, the authentication process 160 in the transceiver 120 applies the authentication instruction 173 that matches the request authentication result 141 to the request data value 142 from the authentication request 140 to produce the
authentication response 144 containing the calculated authentication response answer 145.
<BR><BR>To do so, in step 211, the authentication process 160 in the transceiver 120 applies the authentication instruction 173 (the logic instruction from Column 3) to the request data value 142 in conjunction with the transceiver identification code
181 to obtain the authentication response answer 145 that is then packaged into an authentication response packet 144.  As an example, if the authentication instruction 173 is a logical AND instruction, the in step 211, the authentication processor 160
performs a logical AND operation between the request data value 142 (received from the control station 110) and the transceiver identification code 181 (e.g., an EPC code specifically assigned to this transceiver during the configuration stage) to
produce a result reflecting the AND'ed value of these two numeric values.  This AND'ed result is the authentication response or result 145.
<BR><BR>In one embodiment of the invention, the matching authentication instruction 173 is a roll forward, or a roll back, instruction set instruction.  This type of instructions causes the authentication instructions 173 in Column 3 to be shifted up or
down in position (relative to the fixed position transceiver authentication results 171 in column 1).  In such cases, in step 210, the authentication process 160 in the transceiver 120 uses the request data value 142 from the authentication request 140
as a parameter to indicate how many instruction positions are to be to produce the authentication response 144 containing the calculated authentication response answer 145.  That is, when the authentication request matches a roll forward or roll back
instruction, the transceiver shifts a relationship position of the authentication instructions relative to the transceiver authentication values in the authentication credentials by an amount specified by the request data value, such that each
transceiver authentication value in the authentication credentials corresponds to a different authentication instruction than prior to shifting the relationship.  In the example authentication credentials in the table above, if the request data value 142
specified a position of two and the instruction was to shift the instruction set up, then each instructions would be moved up two position in the table such that, for example, the NAND instruction would correspond to the XOR transceiver authentication
value 171.
<BR><BR>In step 212 the transceiver 120 transmits the authentication response 144 (containing the result 145) to the control station 110 to allow the control station 110 to determine (e.g., via application of the same process using its credential
information 170 and comparing the result 145 to its own result) if the transceiver 120 is authorized to communicate within the remote identification system 100.  Steps 213 through 217 are performed by the control station to check the return
authentication response 144 from the transceiver 120 to determine if the transceiver is to be allowed to communicate on the network 100.
<BR><BR>In step 213, the control station 110 receives the authentication response 144 containing the authentication response answer 145.
<BR><BR>Next, in step 214, the control station 110 validates the authentication response answer 145 within the authentication response 144 against a control station response.
<BR><BR>To do so, in step 215, the control station 110 validates the authentication response answer by applying the authentication instruction 173 (the logic instruction from Column 3) to the request data value 142 in conjunction with the transceiver
identification code 181 in order to produce a control station response 157.
<BR><BR>In step 216, the control station compares the control station response 157 to the authentication response answer or result 145 within the authentication response answer 144 to determine if they are equivalent.
<BR><BR>In step 217, if the control station response 157 and the authentication response answer 145 are equivalent, the control station 110 has successfully authenticated the transceiver 120 and the transceiver 120 is allowed to communicate within the
network 100.  As such, the control station 110 returns an authentication success message 147 to the transceiver 120 indicating the outcome of the authentication processing.  If the authentication response answer or result 145 returned from the
transceiver 120 to the transceiver authenticator 150 in step 213 matches the result 157 produced in the control station 110, then the authentication success message 147 indicates that the transceiver 120 is allowed to participate in RFID communications
on the network 100.  If the authentication response answer 145 returned from the transceiver 120 to the transceiver authenticator 150 in step 213 does not match the result 157 produced in the control station 110, then the authentication success message
147 can repeat the processing above for another selected authentication value 171 (e.g., by choosing another string in the credentials 170) or the control station 110 can thereafter ignore further communications from that disallowed transceiver 120.
<BR><BR>In this manner, the authentication credentials 170 for processing as explained above allow the control station 110 to authenticate each transceiver 120 within the wireless radio frequency identification network 100.  By providing the set of
authentication values such as character strings that map to corresponding authentication instructions 173 via an authentication function 175, and by requiring the transceiver 120 to perform a matching hash technique to identify an appropriate instruction
to apply to the request data value and 43, embodiments of the invention allow the control station to be assured that only transceivers 120 configured with the appropriate authentication credentials 170 unable to produce an acceptable authentication
response answer 145.  In this manner, embodiments of the invention enabled the ability to the control station 110 to only accept communications from authenticated and allowed transceivers 120.
<BR><BR>Note that the processing explained above can be performed repeatedly for different hash values and data to confirm instruction set validity.  Also, by performing this processing periodically, the control station can detect when a transceiver
device attempts to assume identity of other already authenticated transceiver.
<BR><BR>Those skilled in the art will understand that there can be many variations made to the embodiments explained above while still achieving the same objective of those embodiments and the invention in general.  As an example, the order of processing
steps could be rearranged while still accomplishing the overall objective of the system of the invention.  In addition, different type of authentication functions could be used besides hash functions, such as signature functions, <B><I>encryption</I></B> functions,
and the like.  Such variations are intended to be covered by the scope of this invention.  As such, the foregoing description of embodiments of the invention is not intended to be limiting.  Rather, any limitations to the invention are presented in the
following claims.
