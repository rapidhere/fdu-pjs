<P>An apparatus for associating information with a carrier and/or at least
     one biological reagent is provided. The apparatus can include a carrier
     adapted to retain at least one biological reagent and at least one
     non-silicon <B><I>Radio Frequency Identification</I></B> Tag (<B><I>RFID</I></B>). The <B><I>RFID</I></B> tag can
     comprise information in the form of an information pointer that can be
     resolved by an information pointer resolution device. The information
     pointer and/or resolution device can be used to access a remote system.
     The carrier can be configured, for example, as a microfluidic processing
     device or a multi-well plate. Methods and systems using the apparatus are
     also provided.

<BR><BR>DESCRIPTION OF VARIOUS EMBODIMENTS
<BR><BR>Reference will now be made in detail to some embodiments, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.  Wherever possible, the same reference numbers are used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.
<BR><BR>According to various embodiments, Radio Frequency Identification ("RFID") provides a convenient mechanism for identifying and detecting sample carriers using wireless electromagnetic signals.  A basic RFID system has at least one RFID reader and
at least one RFID tag.  Typically, RFID readers can include a coil or antenna and circuitry to transmit and receive signals with the coil or antenna.  An RFID tag also includes a coil or antenna and some information that can be read by an RFID reader.
<BR><BR>According to various embodiments, the RFID reader antenna can generate an electromagnetic field, thereby transferring energy to the tag.  Depending on the design of the tag, a portion of the energy transferred to the tag will be reflected to the
reader so as to provide information about the tag back to the reader.  Some RFID systems can be used to read and optionally write information to and from the RFID tag.  RFID readers can generate signals spanning distances from less than one inch to more
than 100 feet depending on frequency and power of the signals generated at the RFID reader antenna.
<BR><BR>According to various embodiments, the RFID tags can be categorized as either active or passive.  Active RFID tags are powered by an internal battery and are typically read/write, i.e., tag data can be rewritten and/or modified.  An active tag's
memory size varies according to application requirements; some systems operate with up to 1 MB of memory.
<BR><BR>According to various embodiments, the passive RFID tags can operate without a separate external power and obtain operating power generated from the reader.  Passive tags are consequently typically lighter than active tags, less expensive, and
offer a long operational lifetime.  Passive tags typically have shorter read ranges than active tags and require a higher-powered reader.  Read-only tags are typically passive and can be programmed with a unique set of information (usually 32 to 128
bits) that is typically predetermined at the time of manufacture of the tag.  It is understood that passive read/write tags can also be employed consistent with the present teachings.
<BR><BR>The term "RFID tag" as used herein can, in some embodiments, refer to either an active or passive RFID tag that contains information.  The RFID tag can be read only or read/write, and the information associated with the RFID tag can be hard-coded
into the RFID tag at the time of manufacture or at some later time, or the RFID tag can contain information that is written to the RFID tag throughout its lifetime.  The RFID tag can be coated with at least one layer of material, for example, a
protective polymer or a glass, including polystyrene, heavy metal-free glass, plastic, ceramic, and can be coated with more than one layers of this and other materials.  For example, it may be coated with a ceramic or glass, which is then coated with or
linked to the carrier material.  Alternatively, the glass or ceramic or other coating can serve as the carrier.  Radio frequencies can be used to communicate with the RFID tag.  According to various embodiments, other frequencies or lasers can be used to
communicate with the RFID tag, as long as the selected frequency or laser does not interfere with the interactions of the molecules or biological particles of interest.  Thus, information in the form of data points can be stored or referenced in, and
retrieved from the data storage device by application of a selected electromagnetic radiation frequency.
<BR><BR>The term "non-silicon RFID tag" as used herein can, in some embodiments, refer to an RFID tag comprising organic material and/or a polymer RFID tag comprising a metal dopant, and a polymeric material.  Exemplary non-silicon RFID tags are,
described in U.S.  Published Patent Applications Nos.  US 2003/0151028 A1, US 2004/0094949 A1, US 2004/0175550 A1, US 2004/0175515 A1, and US 2004/0175548 A1, all of which are incorporated in their entireties by reference.
<BR><BR>The term "RFID reader" as used herein can, in some embodiments, refer to RFID devices that can read information from and/or write information into an RFID tag.
<BR><BR>The term "carrier" as used herein can, in some embodiments, refer to a structure for directly or indirectly supporting a biological reagent.  Examples of carriers include reaction plates, tubes, tube carriers, surface plasmon resonance arrays,
slides, conical low-volume tubes, microfluidic cards, microarray cartridges, microarrays, sample preparation devices, assay preparation devices, electrophoretic type device, electroosmotic type devices, immunoassays, combinatorial libraries, molecular
libraries, phage display libraries, DNA libraries, DNA fingerprinting devices, SNP detection devices, vacuum containers, and other types of containers for supporting biological reagents.  The carrier can be a multi-well tray including, for example, 4,
12, 24, 48, 96, 192, 384, 768, 1536, 3072, 6144, 12288, or more wells or sample retainment regions.  The carrier can be a carrier as described, for example, in U.S.  patent application Ser.  No. 10/944,691, filed Sep. 17, 2004, which is incorporated
herein in its entirety by reference.  The carrier can retain a fluid, if the carrier can be utilized to transfer, contain, encompass, or otherwise hold, permanently or temporarily, a fluid.  The carrier material can comprise any materials used in
chemical and biochemical synthesis.  The carrier material can comprise polymeric materials that are compatible with chemical and biological syntheses and assays, and include glasses, silicates, celluloses, polystyrenes, polysaccharides, sand, and
synthetic resins and polymers, including acrylamides, particularly cross-linked polymers, cotton, and other such materials.  The carrier material can be in the form of particles or can be continuous in design, such as a test tube or microtiter plate or
the like.
<BR><BR>The term "biological reagent" as used herein can, in some embodiments, refer to a biological material used for various biological analyses such as detecting, examining, and/or measuring information from biological samples.  Biological analyses
can include reactions such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), ligase chain reaction, antibody binding reaction, oligonucleotide ligation assays, and hybridization assays.  Examples of biological reagents include nucleic acids, primers, probes, other
biological reagents, biological samples, environmental samples, other types of samples, proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, bodily fluids, biopsy, cheek swab, other patient samples, a biological particle, and combinations there of, which can be used in

<BR><BR>The term "coupling" as used herein can, in some embodiments, comprise two items being in physical contact with each other, directly or indirectly, or in proximity with each other.  For example, a biological reagent can be in physical contact with
the carrier, that in turn can be in physical contact or in the proximity of the RFID tag.  The carrier can be on a surface of the RFID tag and the molecules and biological particles can be in physical contact with the carrier.  An RFID tag, a polymer
RFID tag, printed on a carrier is said to be coupled to that carrier.  Coupling can be effected by placing the RFID tag on or in the carrier material or in a solution that is in contact with the carrier material or by linking the RFID tag, either by
direct or indirect covalent or non-covalent interactions, chemical linkages or by other interactions, to the carrier.  For example, such contact can be effected chemically, by chemically coupling the RFID tag to the carrier, or physically by coating the
RFID tag with the carrier material or another material, by physically inserting or encasing the RFID tag in the carrier material, by placing the RFID tag onto the carrier or by printing the RFID tag on the carrier material or by any other means by which
the RFID tag can be placed in contact with or in proximity to the carrier material.  Coupling can comprise affixing, embedding, attaching, printing, bonding, coating, otherwise coupling, or any combination thereof.
<BR><BR>The term "information" as used herein can, in some embodiments, refer to data that can be stored or referenced electronically in the RFID tag.  The information can be retrieved from a memory in/on the RFID tag itself.  An information pointer
resolution device can retrieve the information.  The information pointer resolution device can use the identification to retrieve apparatus, biological reagent, and/or carrier information.  The information pointer resolution device can use the
information retrieved from the memory in/on the RFID tag itself to retrieve apparatus, biological reagent, and/or carrier information.  The information can be machine readable and/or human readable data.  Information can be utilized for processing the
biological reagent, a reader, carrier, a biological instrument capable of utilizing the carrier, or any combination thereof.  Information used herein comprises all types of information described herein.
<BR><BR>The term "identification information" as used herein can, in some embodiments, refer to information on an RFID tag that can be used to uniquely identify a particular carrier or biological reagent or to distinguish the carrier or biological
reagent from other carriers or biological reagents.  For example, identification can relate a particular assay prepared for a particular customer.

<BR><BR>According to various embodiments, the module, macro, and/or method information includes parameters that can be used by the instrument data acquisition and control software to perform specific data acquisition and instrument control operations. 
In various embodiments, the method and/or module information contains sequences of operations to be performed by the instrument or control parameters for use in connection with the data acquisition or control software.
<BR><BR>FIG. 12 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of an RFID writing apparatus 1200 consistent with the present teachings.  RFID carrier 1108 is shown with an associated read/write capable RFID tag 1209.  In various embodiments, an RFID reader 1202,
having RFID read and write capabilities and antenna 1204, is coupled to the databases 1120, 1130, 1140, and 1150 including identification, supplemental, rights, and instrument operation information respectively.  In this configuration any combination of
identification, supplemental, rights, and/or instrument operation information can be written to the RFID tag 1209 consistent with the present teachings.
<BR><BR>FIG. 13 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of RFID tag tracking systems 1300 consistent with the present teachings.  A warehouse 1306 or manufacturing facility includes one or more RFID readers 1308, which can be used to read RFID tags on
carriers such as carrier 1108 as the carriers move throughout the warehouse 1306 or manufacturing facility.  The RFID readers 1308 can be used for inventory control and to provide real-time product location information.  In various embodiments an
instrument 1106 can perform operations on a biological reagent being supported by the carrier 1108, while the RFID reader 1308 provides general location information regarding a location of the carrier 1108.  Moreover, the external RFID reader 1304 can
read from and/or write information into the RFID tag 1109.  In various embodiments, external, hand-held RFID readers such as the RFID reader 1304 can be used to write to or read information from the RFID tags 1109.  According to various embodiments,
obtaining the real-time physical location coordinates of a carrier can be achieved by receiving GPS coordinates from a GPS receiver physically coupled to the carrier.
