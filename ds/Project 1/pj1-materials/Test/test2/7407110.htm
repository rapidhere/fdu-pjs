<P>A <B><I>radio frequency identification</I></B> device (<B><I>RFID</I></B>) and method for
     authenticating RFIDs are disclosed. In RFIDs, data is stored in a form of
     data segments selectively associated with promiscuous and non-promiscuous
     regions of their memories. A randomly selected portion of a content of a
     non-promiscuous region is examined by an interrogating readers or a host
     computer after validating the data contained in a promiscuous region.

<CENTER><B><I> Description</B></I></CENTER> <HR> <BR><BR>FIELD OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to a field of radio frequency information acquisition technologies and, in particular, to radio frequency identification devices and methods for authenticating such devices.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>Radio frequency (RF) identification systems use contactless information acquisition technologies to identify objects at a distance and out of a line of sight.  Such systems generally comprise RF transponders ("radio frequency identification"
(RFID) devices, RF interrogators ("readers") of the RFID devices, and a controller with a computerized database.  The RFID devices typically are incorporated in credit card-like plastic enclosures (e.g., smart cards, ID/access cards, and the like) or
directly attached, in a form of RF tags, to the products being monitored or packages thereof.  In operation, the RFID device is presented to a reader that reads data from the RFID device, transmits the data to a controller or host system, where a
decision is made to grant or deny access to an asset, such as a secure location or some sort of device like a computer.  The controller may be centralized and communicate with a plurality of readers or it may be localized and associated with a single
reader.  The latter is referred to as a stand-alone reader.
<BR><BR>In the present state-of-the-art, cards contain data that is promiscuously transmitted when it is excited by being in close proximity to the reader.  The data is transmitted from the first memory location in the card and continues with the next
sequential memory location until a preprogrammed upper limit is reached.  This process repeats continuously restarting at the first memory location after the upper limit has been reached until the card is removed from the reader's RF field.  The reader
receives and stores multiple continuous transmissions and looks for a synchronization sentinel indicating where the data begins.  It then makes sure that a minimum number of identical instances of the data are present to insure that there have been no
data reception errors.  The data is then formatted and transmitted via a communications port to an upstream device for processing and interpretation of the data.  As previously noted, the upstream device may be a remote controller, such as a control
panel or host computer, or it may be localized with the reader.
<BR><BR>A format is a container for the data that defines its content and size.  The supplier and user of the access control system chooses which format is the most suitable based upon the desired data content as well as considerations for security of
the data.  Due to historical and legacy considerations, the number of bits utilized in formats typically range from 26 to 40 bits, although persons of skill in the art will recognize that the number of bits may exceed 40.  Formats that are popular, such
as the "26-bit Wiegand format" are less secure than formats that contain a larger number of data bits due to the fact that with a relatively few number of bits, the possibility of finding identical cards in a large world-wide card population for a given
format is statistically very likely.
<BR><BR>In one specific application, the RFID devices are used in automated security systems providing controlled access to (or exit from) areas, such as offices, public or commercial buildings, and the like.  In this and similar applications, integrity
of an automated security system may be compromised by attackers eavesdropping RF communications between the RFID device and the reader and cloning a legitimate RFID device, as well as electronically or otherwise tampering with the reader or replacing the
reader with a fraudulent device.
<BR><BR>RFID cards have become a very mature, reliable, convenient, and popular technology and, as a result, a large installed base of older cards and readers exists (legacy cards and readers).  Adding or updating security in older systems such as these
can be difficult, expensive, and time consuming.  What used to be state of the art security technology twenty or even ten years ago is becoming outdated and less secure.
<BR><BR>Conventional systems have several weaknesses that can be exploited since no authentication of the card is performed.  Such weaknesses include, substitution of a legitimate reader with an unauthorized reader, substitution of a bona-fide card with
a clone, reading a card programmed by an illicit source, and reading a card programmed by an unscrupulous or even low cost supplier that does not have the same quality and security measures therein.  Additionally, RFID cards that promiscuously emit
unchanging or static data are subject to replay attacks in which a device pretends to be a legitimate reader in order to acquire the promiscuous data.  An attacker only needs to read the RFID cards of a passerby or simply borrow a legitimate user's card
to harvest data from it for later re-use.
<BR><BR>While there is a constant trend of increased sophistication in attempts to compromise the security systems, the high cost of replacing a network of existing readers with more advanced RF interrogators may delay the response to detected and
anticipated security threats or violations.  Such existing readers or systems may be referred to as legacy readers or systems.  They typically are not state of the art in their functionality and features.
<BR><BR>Ultimately, legacy readers, systems, cards, and protocols need to be replaced or updated with newer more secure identification and/or security systems.  As noted above, this transition can be a very expensive process, especially when a large
installed base of legacy readers and cards exists.  For example, in the event that a large entity wishes to update their security system, immediate replacement of thousands of readers and security credentials would be impossible.  Even if the transition
were performed over the course of a week, that week would provide a window where potential attackers could gain unauthorized access to previously secured assets.  There are also other entities that do not wish to completely update their entire security
systems at once.  These entities require a technology that can work according to both the old legacy system protocols and the new system protocols.
<BR><BR>There is also a threat that older attacking methods may be used to gain illicit access to assets in an updated system.  Both fully updated systems and partially updated systems are still susceptible to the old methods employed by attackers to
gain access or information from security systems.  For example, attackers may attempt to use older legacy readers in order to recover promiscuously transmitted information from genuine access cards.  The promiscuous data may be stolen from a legacy card
and placed on an illicit card or portable electronic emulation device.  An attacker then only has to present the illicit card to a remote reader that has not been updated and the reader cannot tell the difference between the illicit card and the genuine
card because each contains the same data.  Also, attackers may attempt to replace or bypass the new reader with a legacy reader by tapping into the communication lines between the reader and the controller.
<BR><BR>Therefore, there is a need in the art for an improved system and method for authenticating the RFID devices and validating the readers of the RFID devices, especially during, or after completion of, an upgrade of technology in identification
systems.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY
<BR><BR>The present invention generally is a RFID and method for authenticating RFIDs, such as ID/access cards, smart cards, RF tags, cellular phones, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), and the like.  The invention may be used in various applications
utilizing RF information acquisition technologies for identifying a holder (individual or object) of the RFID.
<BR><BR>In one embodiment, an RFID is provided comprising a memory having promiscuous and non-promiscuous regions where at least one of configuration data, authenticating data, or holder data is stored in a form of data segments.  Data stored in a
promiscuous region ("promiscuous data") is transmitted to an interrogating reader when the RFID is placed in an active zone of the reader, whereas a content of the data segment(s) stored in a non-promiscuous region ("non-promiscuous data") is selectively
transmitted to the reader upon a specific request initiated by the reader ("challenge").  Generation and execution of the request for non-promiscuous authentication data typically requires successful decoding and validation of the authentication data
contained in the promiscuous region of the memory.  Of course, authentication of the promiscuous data does not necessarily have to occur.  Rather the reading of the promiscuous data may be viewed as a "handshake" prior to the issuance of challenges to
the RFID.  After this process has occurred, challenges are presented to the RFID and the RFID must authenticate itself by correctly responding to the challenge by transmitting the appropriate non-promiscuous shared-secret data segments.  Only after the
authenticity of the card is determined will the data be transmitted to the upstream device.  In accordance with one embodiment, the reader and/or host computer uses the challenge/response protocol to authenticate the non-promiscuous data stored on the
RFID.
<BR><BR>As used herein, "configuration data" is any data that is related to the configuration of, or communication protocol between, the RFID and/or the reader.  For example, configuration data can include data that tells the card what type of
information should be transmitted back to the reader when queried by a reader.  Additionally, configuration data may include information that relates to the number of memory spaces available and their respective size on a given RFID.  Furthermore, the
configuration data may also indicate how many of those memory spaces contain data and what portion of memory they are associated with (e.g., promiscuous or non-promiscuous).  Configuration data may also be related to the number of allowable bits per
message that can be sent in a given transmission.  The configuration data may be general, in which case it can be stored in the promiscuous region of the memory.  However, if portions of the configuration data are not general, those portions are stored
in the non-promiscuous region of the memory.
<BR><BR>In contrast, "shared-secret data" or "shared-secrets" are data that is specifically required by at least one reader to verify the authenticity of the RFID device.  It is data that is known by both the RFID device and the reading device. 
Shared-secret data may include card identification numbers, passwords, keys, <B><I>encryption</I></B>/decryption schemes, cryptograms, rolling codes, hashes, and the like.  Since shared-secret data is typically unique, it is stored on the non-promiscuous data region.
<BR><BR>As used herein, "holder data" is data that relates to the holder, or intended holder, of the RFID.  Examples of holder data include name, birth date, social security numbers, title, position held in the company, employee badge number, and the
like.
<BR><BR>In another embodiment, there is provided a method for authenticating the RFIDs having memories comprising promiscuous and non-promiscuous regions.  The RFID is positively authenticated when the promiscuous data and a randomly selected portion of
the non-promiscuous data match the records stored in the interrogating reader and/or a host computer of the reader.  In one embodiment, the non-promiscuous data is retrieved from the RFID by the reader issuing a "challenge" for non-promiscuous data.  As
used herein, a "challenge" is understood as a request to retrieve data from one or more random non-promiscuous memory locations in which the authenticity of the data at the location is authenticated (e.g., a cryptogram, etc.).
<BR><BR>In yet another embodiment, there is provided a system including a plurality of RFIDs having memories comprising promiscuous and non-promiscuous regions, a plurality of readers of the RFIDs, and a host computer coupled to the readers and
containing a database of records associated with the RFIDs and the readers.
<BR><BR>In still another embodiment, the RFIDs can be either legacy RFIDs with only a promiscuous memory region, RFIDs with only a non-promiscuous memory region, or RFIDs with both promiscuous and non-promiscuous memory regions.  The system further
includes a plurality of readers of the RFIDs that are capable of reading any type of the provided RFID, and a host computer coupled to the readers containing a database of records associated with the RFIDs and readers.  Specifically, the system allows
for backwards compatibility of a new reader with both a legacy RFID containing only promiscuous data and a new more secure RFID containing promiscuous data, non-promiscuous data, or a combination of the two.  Furthermore, the new RFIDs containing both
promiscuous data and non-promiscuous data are compatible with both legacy readers that only verify promiscuous data and newer more secure readers that authenticate the non-promiscuous data of the RFIDs using a challenge/response protocol.
<BR><BR>In a further embodiment, the reader may verify at least a portion of the non-promiscuous data from the newer RFIDs after it has verified the authentication data stored in the promiscuous region of the newer RFID.  However, for the legacy RFIDs,
the reader will either allow the holder of the legacy RFID access to the asset if only promiscuous data is required to gain access.  Of course, if non-promiscuous data is also required to gain access, the reader will not allow the holder of the legacy
RFID access to the asset.  Rather, on a holder of the newer RFID will be able to gain access to the asset.
<BR><BR>In embodiments utilizing a "smart card" configuration, the memory of the RFID device may further comprise credential data.  Credential data, i.e., promiscuous, non-promiscuous, and/or secured (not reader accessible) data, may be used by the RFID
device to perform authentication functions that are typically performed by a host computer.  Essentially, the credential data may relate to what assets the particular RFID device has access to and at what times the RFID device (or holder of the RFID
device) may access those assets.  In operation, the RFID device may be presented to a reader that relays back to the RFID device information relating to an asset associated with that reader and what time it is.  While authenticating itself, the RFID
device compares the asset and/or, if appropriate, the time information received from the reader with the credential data stored in its memory to determine if it has access rights to the given asset and, if appropriate, at the current time.  If the RFID
device does have access rights to that particular asset then the RFID device verifies its validity to the reader by emitting a valid signal.  The valid signal may prompt to the reader to release the asset, which it was previously securing.  For example,
the reader may unlock a door, open a door, turn on a computer, etc. If the RFID device does not have access rights to that particular asset then the RFID device does not verify its validity to the reader and no further actions are taken or an invalid
signal is sent to the reader.  The invalid signal may prompt the reader to indicate to the holder of the RFID device that access is not permitted by, for example, flashing a light, emitting a sound, or creating some other type of message.

<BR><BR>The present invention generally is a radio frequency identification device (RFID) and method for authenticating RFIDs, such as ID/access cards, smart cards, RF tags, and the like.  The invention advantageously addresses deficiencies of the prior
art and may be utilized within the context of security systems, as well as be equally efficiently utilized in a broad range of other applications using interactive computerized data acquisition techniques, both contactless or requiring a physical contact
with a carrier of pre-programmed information (e.g., monitoring moving objects, tracking inventory, verifying credit cards, and the like).
<BR><BR>FIG. 1 depicts a high-level, schematic diagram of an exemplary system 100 for authenticating RFIDs of the kind that may be used to practice portions of the invention.  Hereafter, similar apparatuses, devices and interfaces are identified using
the same numeric references, except that suffixes may be added, when appropriate, to differentiate such apparatuses, devices, and interfaces.
<BR><BR>In one embodiment, the system 100 comprises a host computer 110, a plurality 115 of K RFIDs 130, and a plurality 105 of N readers 120 of the RFIDs 130.  As used herein, N and K are integers wherein N.gtoreq.1, K.gtoreq.1, and typically K&gt;N.
The plurality of readers 105 may include readers 120 of the same type, as well as readers of different types or readers having different computing and/or interrogating capabilities.  In the depicted embodiment, the readers 120 are coupled to the host
computer 110 via an optional interconnecting hub 114.  In an alternate embodiment (not shown), the readers 120 may directly be coupled to the respective inputs/outputs of the host computer 110.  Interfaces 112 and 116 between the readers 120, the hub
114, and the host computer 110 are generally bi-directional interfaces, which may selectively be implemented in a form of wired, wireless, coaxial, or fiber-optic communication links or combinations thereof.  Even though the interfaces 112 and 116 are
depicted as bi-directional interfaces, one of skill in art can appreciate that the interfaces 112 and 116 may be implemented with uni-directional interfaces that use a uni-directional communication protocol, for example, the Wiegand protocol.
<BR><BR>As can be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the interfaces 112 and 116 may be implemented utilizing buses or other types of connections.  For example, the I/O ports may be one or more of a USB port, parallel port, serial port, Small
Computer Systems Interface (SCSI) port, modem, Ethernet, and/or an RF interface.  The protocols used to communicate between the host computer 110 and the readers 120 may include one or more of the TCP/IP protocol, RS 232, RS 485, Current Loop, Power of
Ethernet (POE), Bluetooth, Zigbee, GSM, WiFi, and other communication methods and protocols known in the art.
<BR><BR>Bi-directional RF interfaces 125 between a reader 120 and a RFID 130 are automatically established when the RFID is placed in an active zone (not shown) of the interrogating reader (RF interface 125.sub.1 between the reader 120.sub.1 and RFID
130.sub.2 is illustratively shown).  Herein the active zone of the reader 120 is defined as a three dimensional space where intensity of RF signals emitted by the reader exceeds a threshold of sensitivity of the RFID 130 and intensity of RF signals
emitted by the RFID 130 exceeds a threshold of sensitivity of the reader 120.
<BR><BR>The host computer 110 may be a general-purpose computer adapted for multi-task data processing and suitable for use in an industrial setting.  A memory of the host computer 110 comprises software program(s) containing at least one of a database
of records associated with the readers 120, the RFIDs 130 and their respective holders or users, algorithms(s) for acquiring, decoding, verifying, and modifying data contained in the RFIDs 130, algorithm(s) for testing authenticity and validity of the
RFIDs 130, and algorithm(s) for implementing the results of these tests.  Specific configuration of the host computer 110 is determined based on and compliant with computing and interfacing capabilities of the readers 120.  Hereafter, in reference to an
individual or an object associated with the RFID 130, the terms a "holder" and a "user" are used interchangeably.
<BR><BR>Each reader 120 is adapted for exchanging information with the host computer 110 and for requesting data from the RFID 130 placed in the active zone of the reader.  The reader 120 may also be adapted for processing at least a portion of the data
acquired from the RFID 130.  Alternatively, processing of the acquired data may be performed using the host computer 110.  In one embodiment, the reader 120 generates signals facilitating execution of the results of interrogating the RFID (e.g.,
engages/disengages a locking mechanism, allows/disallows movement of a monitored article, temporarily disables itself, activates an alarm system, and the like).  Alternatively, the host computer 110 may generate such signals.
<BR><BR>In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, a stand-alone reader 120, which includes the functionality of both the reader 120 and the host computer 110, may be utilized.  This stand-alone reader may include, or have access to, the
database that contains data used to determine the authenticity of an RFID device and/or algorithm(s) used to make the determination of authenticity of the RFID device.  A determination of authenticity for an RFID device is made at the receiving point
rather than having to transmit data across a network from the reader to a host computer 110/control panel in order to make a determination of authenticity.  The stand-alone reader is further operable to execute instructions based upon the analysis of the
RFID device.
<BR><BR>FIG. 2 depicts a high-level, exemplary schematic diagram of the RFID 130 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.  In the depicted embodiment, the RFID 130 illustratively comprises a controller 202, a memory 204, a RF
receiver/transmitter 220 including a RF modulator/demodulator unit (MDU) 206 and a RF antenna 208, an optional RF rectifier 210, and/or an optional power supply 212.  The controller 202 (e.g., application specific integrated circuit (ASIC),
microprocessor, programmable controller, and the like) uses bi-directional interfaces 203 and 207 to the memory 204 and MDU 206, respectively, to facilitate data exchanges in the RFID 130 and wireless communications with an interrogating reader (e.g.,
reader 120.sub.2 of FIG. 1).  In an alternate embodiment (not shown), at least portions of the MDU 206 may be incorporated in the controller 202.
<BR><BR>The RFID 130 may be fabricated as a system-on-chip (SoC) device, a system-in-package (SiP) device, or a system in-module (SiM) device.  In the SoC device, various functional components are integrated onto a single die.  Accordingly, in SiP and
SiM devices, several SoC devices are combined in a single package (SiP device) or an assembly including SoC and/or SiP devices (SiM device), respectively.
<BR><BR>A "passive" RFID 130 uses RF signals (i.e., RF radiation) emitted by the reader 120 as a source of energy for powering the RFID.  When a passive RFID comes within range of an interrogating, the reader provides power to the RFID via a querying RF
signal.  The passive RFID 130 comprises the RF rectifier 210 (as shown in FIG. 2) converting a portion of RF power collected by the antenna 208 in the DC power facilitating operability of the RFID.  Such a RFID can operate only in the active zone of an
interrogating reader and is inactive otherwise.
<BR><BR>Alternatively, the RFID 130 may comprise an internal (i.e., on-board) power source 212, e.g., one or several batteries and/or solar cells ("active" RFID).  In yet another embodiment, the RFID 130 comprises both the RF rectifier 210 and the power
source 212 ("semi-active" RFID).  Active and semi-active RFIDs can typically be used at greater distances from the readers than the passive ones, as well may be provided with additional computing and/or sensing capabilities.
<BR><BR>In operation, the reader 120 and RFID 130 use pre-programmed communication protocols.  To increase probability of error-free reception, the same messages may redundantly be repeated a pre-determined number of times or during a pre-determined time
interval.  The interrogating reader 120 generates an interrogating RF signal.  The interrogating RF signal of the interrogating reader 120 (or, in passive or semi-passive RFIDs, a portion of that signal) is received by the RFID antenna 208 and is
forwarded to the MDU 206 that demodulates the RF signal and provides the demodulated signal for processing to the controller 202.  When the received RF signal contains a request for data identifying the RFID 130 and/or a holder of the RFID, the
controller accesses the memory 204 for this data and, via the MDU 206 and antenna 208, transfers the requested data to the reader 120.
<BR><BR>The memory 204 comprises a promiscuous region 302 and a non-promiscuous region 304 and contains configuration and authenticating data of the RFID 130, and holder-specific data, which are selectively stored in the regions 302 and 304 of the memory
in a form of data segments 310 (discussed in detail in reference to FIGS. 3-4).  Specifically, a card manufacturer may choose to load a particular type of data on the promiscuous memory region 302 and another type of data on the non-promiscuous memory
region 304.  A system operator may selectively change where these types of data are located on the RFID 130.
<BR><BR>Holder specific data or credential data includes, but is not limited to, name, birth date, social security numbers, title, position held in the company, access rights of the holder, employee badge number, and the like.  Data stored in the
promiscuous region 302 ("promiscuous data") is automatically transmitted to the interrogating reader 120 when the controller 202 detects a querying RF signal of the reader (i.e., when the RFID 130 is disposed in the active zone of that reader).  Data
stored in the non-promiscuous region 304 ("non-promiscuous data") is selectively transmitted to the interrogating reader upon an additional request from the reader, typically in the form of a challenge.  Initiation and execution of such a request require
successful decoding and validation of the promiscuous data, possibly including authentication data, by the interrogating reader 120 and/or the host computer 110.
<BR><BR>The memory 204 of a passive RFID generally comprises at least one array of non-volatile memory cells, e.g., Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EPROM) cells or FLASH memory cells, among other types of non-volatile memory cells.  The memory
204 of an active RFID having a battery or similar powers source may additionally comprise at least one array of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) cells.  A content of at least a portion of the memory 204 may be pre-programmed and write-protected
thereafter, whereas the content of other portions of the memory may selectively be modified or erased using the reader 120.
<BR><BR>FIG. 3 depicts an exemplary memory map 300 of the memory 204 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.  In the depicted embodiment, the memory map 300 comprises a plurality of M data segments (or "words") 310 each having a
pre-determined bit length, wherein M is an integer and M.gtoreq.2.
<BR><BR>Illustratively, a data segment 310.sub.0 contains configuration data of the memory map 300, data segments 310.sub.1, 310.sub.2, and 310.sub.3 contain a password, a unique ID (UID) of the RFID 130, and a manufacturer ID (MID) of the RFID 130,
respectively, and data segments 310.sub.4-310.sub.M contain user/holder data.
<BR><BR>In one embodiment, the UID is a serial number (SN) of the RFID 130, the MID is a number or name assigned to a group of RFIDs (e.g., RFIDs fabricated for the same customer, RFIDs fabricated for use within certain area, and the like), and the user
data is user credential such as user name, employee badge number, and the like.  In an alternate embodiment, at least one of the data segments 310.sub.1, 310.sub.2, or 310.sub.3 may contain the user data.  At least a portion of the data segments
310.sub.1-310.sub.3 and one or more adjacent data segments 310.sub.4-310.sub.M may be associated with the promiscuous region 302 of the memory 204, whereas the remaining data segments 310 are associated with the non-promiscuous region 304 of the memory. 
In the depicted embodiment, the data segment 310.sub.0 illustratively belongs to the promiscuous region 302.  Alternatively, the data segment 310.sub.0 may be a portion of the non-promiscuous region 304.
<BR><BR>In the RFID 130, the data segment 310.sub.0 comprises a data format block 306 and a transmission control block 308.  The data format block 306 contains information-describing organization of the memory 204 (e.g., size of the memory, a number and
bit lengths of the data segments, and the like).  The transmission control block 308 contains a code identifying the data segments associated with the promiscuous region 302.  In one exemplary embodiment, a numeric value of the code (i.e., a max block
code) corresponds to a number of data segments adjacent to the data segment 310.sub.0.  For example, when the numeric value of the code is 4, the promiscuous region 302 includes the data segments 310.sub.0-310.sub.3, while the non-promiscuous region 304
comprises the data segments 310.sub.4-310.sub.M.
<BR><BR>In one embodiment, the promiscuous region 302 includes at least the data segments containing the password, the UID, and the MID and may include one or more data segments containing a portion of the user data, site codes, and other data that can
be used to verify authenticity in a legacy system.  Correspondingly, the non-promiscuous region 304 comprises data segments containing, partially or in full, the user data, and other shared-secret data.  In one embodiment, however, some shared-secret
data may be included in the promiscuous region 302 if such shared-secret data is intended for use in legacy systems.
<BR><BR>During programming the RFID 130, a content of at least a portion of the data segments 310 may be encrypted for transmission.  Using a pre-determined algorithm, an <B><I>encryption</I></B> key may be encoded in a specific data segment 310 or a group of the data
segments disposed in the promiscuous region 302 of the memory 204.  Alternatively, the <B><I>encryption</I></B> key or an algorithm for deriving the <B><I>encryption</I></B> key from the data received from the RFID 130 may be contained in the reader 120 or the host computer 110.
<BR><BR>FIG. 4 depicts a flow diagram illustrating a method for authenticating the RFIDs 130 using the system of FIG. 1 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.  In some embodiments, processing steps of the method are performed in the
depicted order.  In alternate embodiments, at least two of these steps may be performed contemporaneously or in a different order.  To best understand the invention, the reader should simultaneously refer to FIGS. 1 and 3-4.  Furthermore, the discussion
of FIG. 4 assumes that the RFID being presented to the reader contains both promiscuous and non-promiscuous data.  However, as can be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the RFID may contain only promiscuous data or only non-promiscuous data.  The
reader may be capable of retrieving and authenticating promiscuous and/or non-promiscuous data.  The system is designed such that the readers are compatible with legacy RFIDs having only promiscuous data and newer more secure RFIDs that have
non-promiscuous data, promiscuous data, and combinations thereof.
<BR><BR>The method starts at step 401 and proceeds to step 405, where an interrogating reader 120 (e.g., reader 120, of FIG. 1) receives a data stream from the RFID 130 (e.g., RFID 130.sub.2 of FIG. 1), which entered an active zone of the reader.  The
received data stream comprises a sequence of repetitive messages each containing a content of the data segments associated with the promiscuous region 302 of the memory 204 of that RFID.  The reader accumulates a statistically significant number of the
messages (e.g., 3-10 or more) to facilitate an error-free interpretation of the received data.  Using computing capabilities of the reader 120 and/or the host computer 110, portions corresponding to the MID, the UID, the password (or other
shared-secrets), and the user data are separated from one another, and contents of individual data segments are recognized.  When the messages are encrypted, using the <B><I>encryption</I></B> key located in the respective data segment(s), the reader 120 or the host
computer 110 decode the encrypted data (e.g., MID, UID, password, and a portion of user data), as discussed above in reference to FIG. 3 prior to analyzing the received data.
<BR><BR>Upon completion of step 405, the method performs validity testing of the received promiscuous data in step 408.  Once the promiscuous data 302 has been validated, the reader 120 may begin initiating challenges to the RFID 130 in order to
authenticate the non-promiscuous data of the RFID 130 as discussed below in reference to decision steps 415, 420, 425, and 430.  Of course, in some embodiments where a legacy reader 120 is employed, the promiscuous data may be the only data read and
analyzed to determine RFID authenticity.  In alternative embodiment, newer readers may be employed that can issue challenges to RFID devices to verify the authenticity of the RFID device.  Thus, the RFID device 130 may be backwards compatible with legacy
readers as well as functional with newer readers.
<BR><BR>Non-provisional data testing is performed by the reader 120 first initiating a challenge to the RFID 130 related to one or more data segments within the non-promiscuous memory region 304.  In response to the challenge, the RFID 130 transmits only
the requested data segments to the reader 120 for comparing security elements in the decoded data with the records stored in or otherwise available to the interrogating reader 120 or the host computer 110.
<BR><BR>A challenge may simply be the reader 120 querying the RFID 130 for a particular item of information.  In order to correctly reply to the challenge, the RFID 130 must send the requested information to the reader 120.  A challenge may also include
the reader 120 requiring the RFID to respond using a particular protocol (i.e., proper encoding, <B><I>encryption,</I></B> frequency, etc.)
<BR><BR>At step 410, the interrogating reader 120 interactively communicates to the RFID 130.  Specifically, the reader 120 requests and receives from the RFID 130 a content of one or more randomly selected data segments 310 associated with the
non-promiscuous region 304 of the memory 204 of the RFID.  For the request to be accepted and executed by the RFID 130, the reader transmits to the RFID a pre-determined message.  In one embodiment, such a message comprises identifiers of the requested
data segments.  In an alternate embodiment, the message may include an alpha-numeric sequence generated using a predetermined algorithm and at least one validated credential received from the promiscuous memory region 302.
<BR><BR>To address requirements of specific applications and functional limitations of the legacy readers 120, the RFIDs 130 may be pre-programmed using a variety of security schemes.  In particular, one or more security elements, such as the MID, the
UID, site code, shared-secret data, the password, or a specific portion of the user data may be absent in the received data stream, however, the data stream always comprises at least one of these security elements.  The method selectively skips a
challenge/query examining the validity of that parameter, as illustratively shown in FIG. 4 using optional links 416 and 418, 422 and 424, 426 and 428, and 432 and 434 depending on the credentials that are required to gain access to a particular asset.
<BR><BR>For example, the reader may not need the MID in order to allow access to an individual, but the UID is a credential associated the non-promiscuous memory that must be challenged and verified by the reader.  When the MID data is not required, but
the UID data is required, the method after step 410 proceeds to step 420 (link 416), thus skipping step 415.  Correspondingly, if a challenge of step 420 is affirmatively responded to and the password data is not required, the method after step 420
proceeds to step 430 (links 424 and 426), thus skipping step 425.  Herein, for purposes of completeness, we assume that the MID, UID, password, and a portion of the user data are a required credential that must be challenged by the reader 120 before
access is granted to a given asset.
<BR><BR>At step 415, the method queries if the MID provided by the RFID 130 being interrogated is correct (i.e., matches the records).  If the query of step 415 is negatively answered, the method proceeds to step 450 where the RFID is rejected and the
holder is denied the requested privileges (e.g., right of access to or exit from an area protected by a mechanism controlled by the reader or the host computer).  If the query of step 415 is affirmatively answered, the method proceeds to step 420.
<BR><BR>At step 420, the method queries if the UID provided by the RFID 130 being interrogated is correct.  When the UID is a serial number, the method may, for example, verify that the provided serial number belongs to a pre-selected range assigned to
the serial numbers.  If the query of step 420 is negatively answered, the method proceeds to step 450.  If the query of step 420 is affirmatively answered, the method proceeds to step 425.
<BR><BR>At step 425, the method queries if the password provided by the RFID 130 being interrogated is correct (e.g., pre-determined alpha-numeric sequence, result of solving a pre-defined logical or mathematical equation, and the like).  If the query of
step 425 is negatively answered, the method proceeds to step 450.  If the query of step 425 is affirmatively answered, the method proceeds to step 440.
<BR><BR>At step 440, the method queries if a content of the received non-promiscuous data segments matches the records.  If the query of step 440 is negatively answered, the method proceeds to step 450.  If the query of step 440 is affirmatively
answered, the method proceeds to step 445.
<BR><BR>At step 445, the interrogating reader 120 (or host computer 110) authenticates the RFID 130 being interrogated and provides a holder of the RFID with privileges listed in the RFID or records stored in or otherwise available to the reader 120 or
the host computer 110.
<BR><BR>At step 450, the RFID 130 that failed at least one of the validity tests discussed above in reference to steps 415, 420, 425, 430, and 440 is rejected as invalid and, as such, a holder of the RFID is denied any privileges the holder of an
authenticated RFID could be entitled to.
<BR><BR>At step 455, to protect integrity of the system 100, the reader 120 or the host computer 110 analyses a number and pattern of events associated with interrogation of invalid RFIDs.  In one embodiment, the host computer disables the reader 120 or
otherwise terminates authentication of the RFIDs 130 by the reader for a pre-determined duration of time or permanently and/or generates a corresponding alarm signal when at least one of the following events is detected: (a) a number of invalid RFIDs
interrogated during a specific time interval exceeds a first pre-determined threshold, (b) a number of consecutively interrogated invalid RFIDs exceeds a second pre-determined threshold, (c) a number of repetitive interrogations of the same invalid
RFID(s) exceeds a third pre-determined threshold, (d) an attempt to extract or erase at least one secret pre-programmed in the reader, or (e) an attempt to temper the reader mechanically or electronically, including an attempt to temper software of the
reader.  In an alternate embodiment, at least a portion of these measures may be performed by the reader.  In another embodiment, using the interrogating reader 120, a content of one or more data segments 410 in an invalid RFID may selectively be
modified or erased to prevent further attempts to authenticate that RFID.  In one embodiment, after being disabled, the reader may be re-enabled using at least one of the host computer, a built-in keypad, or a pre-programmed transferable device, said
device using a means of electrical, magnetic, optical, or radio frequency coupling to the reader.
<BR><BR>At step 460, upon completion of step 445 or step 455, the method ends.
<BR><BR>The present invention, in various embodiments, includes components, methods, processes, systems and/or apparatus substantially as depicted and described herein, including various embodiments, subcombinations, and subsets thereof.  Those of skill
