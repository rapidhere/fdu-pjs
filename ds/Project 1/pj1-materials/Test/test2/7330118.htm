Description</B></I></CENTER> <HR> <BR><BR>BACKGROUND
<BR><BR>In various platforms, such as but not limited to, servers or clients that may need to communicate with other devices, secure communications may be vital.  Secure communications may require encrypted communications and verification of devices;
this may require, in an exemplary method, programmatic writing of PXE server addresses and <B><I>cryptography</I></B> keys by an IT administrator who may manually enter such information.  This existing technique may require powering up of the platform and increase the
chance for human error.
<BR><BR>Thus, a strong need exists for an apparatus and method capable of secure wireless platform provisioning. <BR><BR>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computing system's memories, registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices.
<BR><BR>Embodiments of the present invention may include apparatuses for performing the operations herein.  An apparatus may be specially constructed for the desired purposes, or it may comprise a general purpose computing device selectively activated or
reconfigured by a program stored in the device.  Such a program may be stored on a storage medium, such as, but not limited to, any type of disk including floppy disks, optical disks, compact disc read only memories (CD-ROMs), magnetic-optical disks,
read-only memories (ROMs), random access memories (RAMs), electrically programmable read-only memories (EPROMs), electrically erasable and programmable read-only memories (EEPROMs), magnetic or optical cards, or any other type of media suitable for
storing electronic instructions, and capable of being coupled to a system bus for a computing device.
<BR><BR>The processes and displays presented herein are not inherently related to any particular computing device or other apparatus.  Various general purpose systems may be used with programs in accordance with the teachings herein, or it may prove
convenient to construct a more specialized apparatus to perform the desired method.  The desired structure for a variety of these systems will appear from the description below.  In addition, embodiments of the present invention are not described with
reference to any particular programming language.  It will be appreciated that a variety of programming languages may be used to implement the teachings of the invention as described herein.  In addition, it should be understood that operations,
capabilities, and features described herein may be implemented with any combination of hardware (discrete or integrated circuits) and software.
<BR><BR>Use of the terms "coupled" and "connected", along with their derivatives, may be used.  It should be understood that these terms are not intended as synonyms for each other.  Rather, in particular embodiments, "connected" may be used to indicate
that two or more elements are in direct physical or electrical contact with each other.  "Coupled" my be used to indicated that two or more elements are in either direct or indirect (with other intervening elements between them) physical or electrical
contact with each other, and/or that the two or more elements co-operate or interact with each other (e.g. as in a cause an effect relationship).
<BR><BR>Although not limited in this respect, radio Frequency Identification (RFID) may refer to technologies that may use radio waves to identify objects.  RFID systems may provide non-contact, non-line-of-sight identification.  RFID systems may utilize
three components, an antenna or coil, a transceiver (with decoder), and a transponder (RF tag) electronically programmed with unique information.  However, it is understood that RFID systems may have more or less components based on the use requirements
and the present invention is not limited to the RFID system comprising these components.  The antenna may send out radio signals that activate the tag's electronics allowing data to be read and possibly written to the tag's electronically erasable
programmable read-only memory (EEPROM).  The antenna may be packaged with the transceiver and decoder to become an interrogator, typically called a reader even though it may write to writeable tags as well, although the present invention Is not limited
in this respect.  RFID tags may be read-only or read/write and may be read or written to through a variety of substances where barcodes or other optically read technologies would be useless.  RFID tags may be categorized as either active or passive where
passive tags may obtain power from the reader and operate without a separate external power source while an internal battery powers active tags.
<BR><BR>An embodiment of the present invention provides a system by which a passive read/write RFID tag may be incorporated within any platform, such as, but not limited to, a client or server.  Furthermore, this passive RFID tag may be interfaced with
the platform such that its EEPROM may also be read or written to from the platform using a wired serial connection.  An embedded microcontroller with access to dynamic and non-volatile memory that may operate independently of a host processor and
operating system (OS), with direct access to the network interface as well may be used.  Although the present invention is not limited in this respect, a platform that provides such an embedded microcontroller could be a desktop Ethernet product designed
and manufactured by Intel Corporation and is described in detail with reference to FIG. 3.  However, it is understood that the Ethernet product of FIG. 3 is only an illustrative example and any communication means is anticipated to be within the scope of
the present invention.
<BR><BR>The RFID tag may be read from or written to by either a RFID reader or the platform via a direct serial connection to the embedded processor described above.  The RFID tag may be switched into a serial read only mode, where the contents of the
RFID tag's EEPROM may only be read back via the direct connection to the platform embedded processor and not the RFID reader.  An RFID reader may set the contents of the RFID tag's EEPROM and then switch the RFID tag to the serial read only mode allowing
the contents to be read by the embedded processor.  This combination of technologies allows for wireless configuration and touchless provisioning of any platform via RFID technology.
<BR><BR>Although not limited in this respect, an embodiment of the present invention may utilize PXE (Preboot Execution Environment) to facilitate touchless provisioning of a platform.  PXE may allow for automatic device provisioning once the device has
power and network connectivity.  The initial process to get a device provisioned may use, although is not limited to, a PXE implementation on the device using PXE DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) to determine which PXE server to contact and a
boot file name.  The device may then contact that PXE server and the boot image may be transferred using TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol).  One concern with automatic configuration/provisioning may be security.  PXE may use Boot Integrity Services
(BIS) to validate the boot image.  BIS uses both digital signatures (credentials) and public key <B><I>cryptography</I></B> to perform an integrity and authorization check.  In an embodiment of the present invention, the PXE client must have a BIS-enabled BIOS in
order to use BIS, however, the present invention is not limited to the PXE client having a BIS-enabled BIOS.  The BIS-enabled client may request that the proper boot image credentials be downloaded from the PXE server as well.  The administrator's public
and private key pair may be generated and stored on the server.  In an embodiment of the present invention, and not limited in this respect, before booting, the administrator's public key may be embedded in a digital certificate and stored on the client. In BIS, a digital certificate may include at least the client's public key, the server's public key and the digital signature (credential) of the certificate that is generated using the server's private key.  Subsequently, the boot image may be executed
only if the credentials supplied for the boot image match those in the digital certificate stored on the client.
<BR><BR>An embodiment of the present invention provides that the integrated RFID tag may contain both an external passive RF interface as well as an internal serial system bus interface that may allow the device to talk directly to the tag.  Further, the
present invention is capable of storing information independently of the state of the host OS.  The RFID tag of one embodiment of the present invention may be configured to accept commands only through system bus interface or via the RF interface as
well.  To allow for device configuration, an RFID reader may be used to write security keys as well as a PXE server address to the RFID tag and after this initial writing, the reader then may lock the tag from receiving any further RF interface commands. This restricts access to RFID tag information to the device itself.  During preboot, the present invention may access this information using the direct serial bus interface to the integrated RFID tag and may copy it to memory on the device.
<BR><BR>At this point, the device may contact the PXE (Preboot Execution Environment) server to obtain the required boot image.  Once the device has configured the security keys, it may be erased from the RFID tag and the RF interface may be opened to
allow other information such as device system description to be written to the RFID tag and made available to external RFID readers for the purpose of identifying a machine, its location, and its current configuration wirelessly, even when the machine is
not powered.
<BR><BR>Turning now to the figures, at FIG. 1, shown generally at 100, is an illustration of an apparatus, such as deployed server 140, configured using an embodiment of the present invention.  RFID tag 107 may be coupled with the apparatus 140 and the
RFID tag 107 enabling wireless provisioning and configuration of the apparatus 140 by interfacing with a RFID reader 130 capable of assigning security keys and PXE server address wirelessly 105.  After security keys and PXE server address are assigned,
the apparatus (e.g. server in one embodiment of the present invention) contacts 115 a PXE server 135 using the address and keys assigned by the RFID reader 130 to server 140.  The operating system may then be installed and configured 120 in the server
140 by PXE server 135.  At 125 the server 140 is now provisioned and services running and RFID tag 107 may provide RFID reader 130 with system identity and configuration.
<BR><BR>Turning now to FIG. 2, illustrated generally at 200, is a flow chart for the process of one embodiment of the present invention.  RFID reader 130 is used to assign <B><I>cryptography</I></B> keys and a PXE server address to the apparatus 140 at 205.  At 210
the RFID tag may be locked from receiving any further RF interface commands and the apparatus 140 may be deployed.  At 220 a read attempt on the RFID tag may be made and if RF is used, a locked error is returned to the reader at 215.  If a read attempt
is made using a direct serial bus interface, the embedded processor may move the stored information on the tag into memory on the device and erase the EEPROM of the RFID tag.  However, the present invention is not limited in this respect.  Then at 230,
using the information from the RFID tag, the device may now contact the PXE server and verify and install the boot image.  At 235, the operating system is up and running and the result of the system provisioning, including system identity information and
configuration, is written to the RFID tag.  The integrated tag is then unlocked for access using the RF interface as well.
<BR><BR>Another read attempt may then be made at 240 and, if using RF, the information stored on the tag may be received at 245.  If using the direct serial bus interface, the information stored on the tag may be received and may be verified to insure it
reflects the current configuration.  The process ends at 255.
<BR><BR>Turning now to FIG. 3, illustrated generally as 300, is a diagram illustrating an RFID tag's EEPROM platform interconnect with the platform having read/write access to RFID tag's EEPROM.  The RFID reader 305 may wirelessly store security keys 310
to the RFID tag's EEPROM 355.  Platform 345 may by physically linked 350 from the platform 345 to the RFID tag's memory such as EEPROM 355.  Although not limited in this respect, the RFID tag 355 (shown as 107 in FIG. 1) may be a passive read/write RFID
tag and the apparatus 140 may be, although it is not required to be, a platform, such as a client or server.  The physical link 350 from the platform 345 to the RFID tag's memory may be used by an embedded microcontroller 340 to access the stored
security keys 320.  The security keys 310, 320 may be used for PXE provisioning 330 to install an operating system 335.  The embedded microcontroller 340 may also write platform information 325 to the RFID tag 355 using the physical link 350 from the
platform to the RFID tag's EEPROM so that an RFID reader 305 may wirelessly read the platform information 315.
<BR><BR>Yet another embodiment of the present invention provides an article comprising a storage medium having stored thereon instructions, that, when executed by a computing platform, results in wirelessly provisioning and configuring an apparatus by
interfacing an RFID tag with the apparatus, the RFID tag enabling wireless provisioning and configuration of the apparatus, wherein the interfacing an RFID tag may be interfacing an RFID tag that is a passive read/write RFID tag.
<BR><BR>Elaborating on an aforementioned embodiment, the present invention provides an apparatus, comprising: an RFID tag interfaced with said apparatus, said RFID tag enables wireless provisioning and configuration of said apparatus; and an embedded
processor having direct access to said RFID tag.  The embedded processor may have direct access to said RFID tag to provide enhanced security when dealing with contents of said RFID tag.  The contents may include secret keys provisioned via said RF
interface to the RFID tag which may be retrieved by the embedded processor which may operate on said secret keys and perform cryptographic functions on behalf of a local client/server or with remote systems over the network without disclosing the secret
keys.
<BR><BR>The secret keys may be kept private by the embedded processor thereby providing enhanced identity, data integrity, <B><I>encryption</I></B>/decryption, and authentication services and the embedded processor may draw minimal power and therefore remain on and
connected while a local client/server host processor is in a sleep state or powered off, thereby allowing said embedded processor to provide information provisioned via said RFID Tag over a network interface to aid in location assistance of the system as
well as providing asset information regarding the client/server to the network even when the system is powered off.
<BR><BR>While certain features of the invention have been illustrated and described herein, many modifications, substitutions, changes, and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art.  It is, therefore, to be understood that the appended
claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the invention.
