document output apparatuses 120 and 160, and two RFID readers 130 and 170 are shown in FIG. 1.  However, the structure of the apparatus shown in FIG. 1 may be modified into various other forms.
<BR><BR>The document output apparatuses 120 and 160 are controlled by the document management clients 110 and 150 and the document management servers 100 interconnected via a network to store RFID tag information in RFID tags attached to or included in
documents to be output so as to output the documents including the RFID tag information.  In detail, the document output apparatuses 120 and 160 may be printers, copiers, facsimiles, or the like.  A printer, a copier, and facsimiles will be described in
detail with reference to FIGS. 2A through 2C.
<BR><BR>The document management clients 110 and 150 provide RFID tag information of online documents and data of documents to be output to the document output apparatuses 120 and 160, respectively.  The document management clients 110 and 150 are
controlled by the document management server 100 so as to provide RFID tag information of online documents they have to the document management server 100.
<BR><BR>The RFID readers 130 and 170 detect RFID tag information from RFID tags attached to output offline documents and provide RFID detection signals to the document management clients 110 and 150.  The document management clients 110 and 150 receive
the RFID detection signals from the RFID readers 130 and 170 and transmit the RFID detection signals to the document management server 100.  In the present embodiment, the RFID readers 130 and 170 transmit the RFID detection signals to the document
management clients 110 and 150.  However, according to an aspect of the present invention, the RFID readers 130 and 170 may directly transmit the RFID detection signals to the document management server 100.
<BR><BR>The document management-server 100 determines whether to authorize an output of a corresponding document, manages values stored in the RFID tags and document information related to the RFID tags, and performs a log function of managing
generation, output, copy, transmission, drain, and scrap of documents including RFID tags.

obtained by reading RFID tags of an offline document using the RFID readers 130 and 170.  Here, the receiver 310 may directly receive the RFID tag information from the RFID readers 130 and 170.  In a case where the RFID readers 130 and 170 interface with
the document management clients 110 and 150, respectively, the receiver 310 may receive the RFID tag information from the document management clients 110 and 150.
<BR><BR>In operation S820, the RFID tag information analyzer 330 of the document management server 100 analyzes the RFID tag information to generate the RFID tag information analysis signal.
<BR><BR>In operation S840, the document management server 100 manages history information of an output document using the RFID tag information analysis signal.  In detail, the document management server 100 stores and manages the RFID tag information in
the document management information register 320.
<BR><BR>FIG. 9 is a flowchart of operation S460 of the method of FIG. 4 according to another embodiment of the present invention.  Referring to FIG. 9, in operation S900, the receiver 310 of the document management server 100 receives RFID tag
information obtained by reading RFID tags of an offline document using the RFID readers 130 and 170.  Here, the receiver 310 may directly receive the RFID tag information from the RFID readers 130 and 170.  In a case where the RFID readers 130 and 170
interface with the document management clients 110 and 150, respectively, the receiver 310 may receive the RFID tag information from the document management clients 110 and 150.
<BR><BR>In operation S920, the RFID tag information analyzer 330 of the document management server 100 analyzes the RFID tag information to generate the RFID tag information analysis signal.
<BR><BR>In operation S940, the document management server 100 determines whether documents read by the RFID readers 130 and 170 include a document to be scraped.  Here, the determination as to whether the documents includes the document to be scraped is
made by comparing the RFID tag information analysis signal with the document management information stored in the document management information register 320.  If the document management server 100 determines in operation S940 that the documents do not
include the document to be scraped, the document management server 100 returns to operation S900.  If the document management server 100 determines in operation S940 that the documents include the document to be scraped, the document management server
100 proceeds to operation S960.
<BR><BR>In operation S960, the document management server 100 checks a position of the document to be scraped through the RFID tag information analyzer 330 and controls the document management clients 110 and 150 through the transmitter 300 to scrap the
document.  The document management server 100 may directly output a document scrap signal to a corresponding document output apparatus.  In this case, the document management server 100 may display the document scrap signal on the display unit 360.
<BR><BR>As described above, in a method and an apparatus for managing online and offline documents using RFID technology, a document security system can be provided so as to improve security, stability, and the convenience of a user.
<BR><BR>Also, log information can be recorded and observed from the generation of each document to the scrap of the each document to check whether a document on which security level is output, copied, and transmitted to an authenticated user.  In
addition, drain of a security document outside an office or a company can be observed.  When the security document is output, copied, and transmitted, RFID tags can be included in or attached to documents output from RFID output apparatuses.  Thus, these
documents can be managed.  As a result, the overall document security service can be provided to online and offline documents.
<BR><BR>Accordingly, the method and the apparatus of the present invention can be applied to army-related organizations or the government departments necessarily requiring security against offline documents and departments of companies in charge of new
technology development.  Thus, the companies can completely prevent documents from being drained by insiders.  Also, a manager operating a system can minimize the management of networks and stably manage original document files to preserve intellectual
property rights and to efficiently operate system.
<BR><BR>The invention can also be embodied as computer readable codes on a computer readable recording medium.  The computer readable recording medium is any data storage device that can store data which can be thereafter read by a computer system. 
Examples of the computer readable recording medium include read-only memory (ROM), random-access memory (RAM), CD-ROMs, magnetic tapes, floppy disks, optical data storage devices, and carrier waves (such as data transmission through the Internet).  The
computer readable recording medium can also be distributed over network coupled computer systems so that the computer readable code is stored and executed in a distributed fashion.
<BR><BR>While the present invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein
without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the following claims.
