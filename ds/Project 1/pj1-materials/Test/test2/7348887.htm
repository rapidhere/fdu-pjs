<BR><BR>1.  Field of the Invention
<BR><BR>The present invention provides a radio frequency identification (RFID) transceiver and antenna element co-located with a conventional semiconductor device, a method for making same and the method of using the RFID devices of the present invention
for locating, tracking and identifying semiconductor devices and the products in which they are implemented.
<BR><BR>2.  Description of Related Art
<BR><BR>A radio-frequency identification (RFID) transceiver is a device that receives an electronic signal, generates a response signal, and then transmits the response signal.  RFID transceivers have been used to locate, identify and track merchandise
palettes, shipping containers on a palette or individual items within a container, on a retailer shelf or in use by an end user.  The focus of RFID innovation has been on creating high volume, low cost RFID tags so that RFID devices can be universally
deployed on low value items.  Some attention has been paid to locating, identifying and tracking higher value items with RFID technology, but, since these items are less voluminous, cost reduction techniques (the efficiency benefits of using the RFID
technology) can not be fully exploited.
<BR><BR>Some RFID transceivers include one or more antennas that are electrically connected to an accompanying electronic circuit.  The antenna portion of the RFID transceiver is generally many times larger than the electronic circuit itself.  This is
due to the common frequency bands utilized for RFID and the need for an antenna efficiency that provides sufficient range for the transmitted response signal.  The incorporation of the antenna into the RFID IC package does reduce the cost significantly,
but then the cost of the package becomes a significant portion of the RFID and limits the cost reduction possible.
<BR><BR>Since the focus of RFID innovation has been on creating high volume, low cost RFID tags so that RFID devices can be universally deployed on low value items, there has been considerable attention paid to creating integrated circuits (ICs) that
perform the RFID function.

<BR><BR>In addition, U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,654,890 describes a method to wirelessly authenticate laptops to prevent unauthorized users from being able to use the laptops.  Also, many conventional car radios are disabled when removed from vehicles (i.e., the

<BR><BR>The above described patents concern using semiconductor technology to implement the RFID, antennas to be used with the RFID integrated circuits, tracking and sorting semiconductors using separate RFID devices or non-RFID circuit methods of
verifying the correctness, reliability, functionality and trustworthiness of integrated circuits, or providing a means to protect an IC or enclosure from reverse engineering.  As discussed above, although these patents describe methods that can reduce
the cost and size of the RFID, further cost and size reduction is essential for widespread deployment of RFIDs.
<BR><BR>It is desirable to provide a radio frequency identification (RFID) transceiver and antenna element co-located with a standard semiconductor device such that the semiconductor device can be located, tracked and identified itself.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>The present invention provides a RFID device comprising a radio frequency identification (RFID) transceiver and antenna element co-located with a semiconductor device, a method for making same and a method of using the RFID device of the present
invention to locate, track and identify semiconductor devices and the devices they reside in.
<BR><BR>One embodiment of the RFID device of the present invention comprises a radio frequency identification (RFID) transceiver embedded within packaging of a semiconductor device.  A second embodiment of the RFID device of the present invention
comprises a radio frequency identification (RFID) transceiver as a separate circuit block within the semiconductor device.  A third embodiment of the RFID device of the present invention comprises a radio frequency identification (RFID) transceiver as a
separate independent circuit on top of the semiconductor device, System on Chip (SoC).  In each embodiment, the RFID antenna is made to fit within the dimensions of the semiconductor device, has a low profile, has low cost, and exhibits good performance.
<BR><BR>In all cases, the packaging cost of the RFID is eliminated as it is included with the packaging of the semiconductor, dramatically reducing the cost of implementing the RFID.  In addition, when the RFID transceiver is a separate circuit block or
independent circuit within the semiconductor device, the additional circuitry cost of the RFID is nearly eliminated.
<BR><BR>The RFID device of the present invention can be used for locating, identifying and tracking of the semiconductor device which can be a low value item, with RFID technology throughout the logistics process as a stand-alone low value product. 
Alternatively, the RFID device of the present invention can be used for locating, identifying and tracking of the semiconductor device throughout the logistics process as an element within a high value product for which the semiconductor device forms the
basis.  Through repetitive logistics usage, RFID transceivers can also be cost-effectively applied to less voluminous, high value semiconductor products and semiconductor-based products to exploit the efficiency and effectiveness benefits of RFID
technology.
<BR><BR>In the present invention, the RFID transceiver and antenna is co-located with another integrated circuit (IC), either in a hybrid package or as part of the integrated circuit (IC), thus eliminating packaging costs for the RFID.  Even if the
integrated circuit (IC) does not need to be tracked by an RFID, many devices have integrated circuits (ICs) in them, allowing for the RFID to be added to a device at very low cost.
<BR><BR>The RFID device of the present invention can be used for cost-effective circuit design and non-destructive fabrication test and analysis in order to verify the correctness, reliability, and functionality of integrated circuits after fabrication
and ensure optimal coverage of trust issues for integrated circuits.  The RFID transceiver can be included in a package of an integrated circuit (IC) device to allow the integrated circuit (IC) device to be tested for functionality without opening the
package or device.  The use of the RFID device of the present invention allows manufacturers, wholesalers, retail stores and service centers of all types to monitor integrated circuit (IC) devices for internal damage and repair issues at any time.
<BR><BR>The RFID device of the present invention provides locating, tracking and identifying of semiconductor devices and the products in which they are implemented.
<BR><BR>The RFID device of the present invention can be used for protection against reverse engineering by permanently modifying or destroying an integrated circuit (IC) if the integrated circuit (IC) package or enclosure is opened without first
providing a proper encoded signal from a user-specified RFID reader or a nested RFID connected to the radio frequency electronics enclosure.  The presence of the proper encoded signal allows access to the radio frequency electronics without alteration or
destruction.  The RFID device of the present invention can be used to either permanently or temporarily disable a device to deter theft.
<BR><BR>The RFID device of the present invention can be used to destroy or disable an electronic device, such as an integrated circuit (IC) or the subcomponent of a system, upon command from a RFID probing device.  The invention will be more fully
described by reference to the following drawings. <BR><BR>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<BR><BR>Reference will now be made in greater detail to a preferred embodiment of the invention, an example of which is illustrated in the accompanying drawings.  Wherever possible, the same reference numerals will be used throughout the drawings and the
description to refer to the same or like parts.
<BR><BR>FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of RFID device 10 in accordance with the teachings of the present invention.  RFID device 10 comprises radio frequency identification (RFID) transceiver 12 embedded within packaging 14 of semiconductor device 15.  In
one embodiment, packaging 14 can be a carrier.  Semiconductor device 15 comprises integrated circuit (IC) 16 and connections 17.  For example, semiconductor device 15 can be a conventional semiconductor device.  RFID transceiver 12 can be a passive RFID. Interconnection 18 can be used for connection between RFID transceiver 12 and integrated circuit (IC) 16.  Interconnection 18 provides for transmission of probe signals, response signals and the like.  Integrated circuit (IC) 16 is separate from (RFID)
transceiver 12 and performs processing separate from (RFID) transceiver 12.
<BR><BR>RFID transceiver 12 can be the implemented in the same technology as integrated circuit (IC) 16 in which it is packaged, such as SiGe, GaAs, Si, and the like.  Alternatively, RFID transceiver 12 can be a separate integrated circuit (IC) 16 of a
different technology as a hybrid package or integrated circuit (IC) 16.
<BR><BR>In an alternate embodiment, RFID device 20 comprises active RFID, as shown in FIG. 2.  Power connection 22 is provided from RFID transceiver 12 to integrated circuit (IC) 16 to provide the active RFID.  RFID device 10 and RFID device 20 comprise
radio frequency identification (RFID) transceiver 12 as a separate circuit block within semiconductor device 15.
<BR><BR>FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram of RFID device 30 in accordance with the teachings of the present invention.  Radio frequency identification (RFID) transceiver 32 is a separate independent circuit on top of integrated circuit (IC) 36 of
semiconductor device 35 to form a System on Chip (SoC).  Semiconductor device 35 comprises integrated circuit (IC) 36.  For example, semiconductor device 35 can be a conventional semiconductor device.  Interconnection 38 can be used for providing a
connection between RFID transceiver 32 and integrated circuit (IC) 36.  Interconnection 38 provides for transmission of probe signals, response signals and the like.
<BR><BR>RFID transceiver 12 and RFID transceiver 32 have dimensions to fit within the dimensions of respective semiconductor device 15 or semiconductor device 35.  RFID transceiver 12 and RFID transceiver 32 have a low profile, low cost, and exhibit good
performance.  For example, ceramic chip antennas, slot antennas and dielectric resonator antennas can be used in RFID transceiver 12 and RFID transceiver 32.
<BR><BR>FIG. 4 is a schematic diagram of RFID device 40 in accordance with the teachings of the present invention.  Antenna 42 is located on or around RFID transceiver 12 within packaging 14 of semiconductor device 15.  Antenna 42 can be located on
packaging 14.
<BR><BR>In one embodiment, antenna 42 can be placed above entire integrated circuit (IC) 16 and RFID transceiver 12.  This embodiment provides additional room for antenna 42 as integrated circuit (IC) 16 is typically many times the size of RFID
transceiver 12 and space for the antenna is available on or around integrated circuit (IC) 16.
<BR><BR>FIG. 5 is a schematic diagram of RFID device 50 in accordance with the teachings of the present invention.  Antenna 52 is located around RFID transceiver 32 on integrated circuit (IC) 36.
<BR><BR>Referring to FIGS. 6-10, RFID systems 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 comprise respective RFID devices 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50, which can communicate with RFID reader 60.  RFID reader 60 generates signals for transmission to RFID devices 10, 20, 30, 40,
or 50 and receives signals or information from RFID devices 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50.  RFID reader 60 uploads received information to processor 61.
<BR><BR>In one embodiment, RFID reader 60 can be implemented as a nested RFID 70 as shown in FIG. 11 for communicating with RFID devices 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50.  As shown in FIG. 11, RFID 12 is located on the outside of an enclosure 76.  When RFID 12 is
probed, RFID 12 sends probe signals through antenna 77, which is inside the enclosure, to RFID device 10 inside the enclosure, which then respond to the probe from RFID 12.  RFID devices which are shown as RFID device 10 can also be RFID devices 20, 30,
40 or 50.  In an alternate embodiment, the RFID devices within enclosure 76 could also be RFIDs on the outside of another enclosure 76 that in the same manner as described above probe RFIDs inside this enclosure.  Accordingly, the RFIDs can be nested to
any desired level.
<BR><BR>In one embodiment, RFID transceiver 12 or RFID transceiver 32 can receive an encoded signal from RFID reader 60 or nested RFID 70 and generate probe signals along various integrated circuit traces of integrated circuit (IC) 16 or integrated
circuit (IC) 36, as shown in respective FIGS. 6-10.  Also, integrated circuit (IC) 16 or integrated circuit (IC) 36 or RFID transceiver 12 or RFID transceiver 32 can generate particular signals based on the response of the probe signals, and then
transmit the particular response signal from RFID transceiver 12 or RFID transceiver 32 back to RFID reader 60 or nested RFID 70.  Processor 61 communicates with RFID reader 60 to receive the particular response signal and process the information.
<BR><BR>RFID systems 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 can be used to verify the correctness, reliability, and functionality of integrated circuits after fabrication to ensure that the various integrated circuit blocks function as designed and that additional
circuitry or embedded functions have not been surreptitiously added to the circuit, i.e., to enable users to trust the integrated circuits they employ.  In one embodiment, RFID probe-response signals generated by integrated circuit (IC) 16 or integrated
circuit (IC) 36 or RFID transceiver 12 or RFID transceiver 32 can be based on a secure challenge-response protocol to ensure that when a response is received, the device receiving the response to its challenge can be assured that the response was
generated with authenticated verification of the intended device characteristics, i.e. it is necessary to be able to discriminate against devices which have been altered, but respond as if they have not.
<BR><BR>In one embodiment, encoded signals 62 can be communicated from RFID reader 60 or nested RFID 70 to RFID transceiver 12 or RFID transceiver 32 over connection 63.  The encoded signals can be used to protect integrated circuit (IC) 16 or integrated
circuit (IC) 36 or packaging 14 from reverse engineering.  If integrated circuit (IC) 16 or integrated circuit (IC) 36 or packaging 14 is opened or probed without RFID transceiver 12 or RFID transceiver 32 first receiving a proper encoded signal 62,
either from user-specified RFID reader 60 or a nested RFID 70, RFID transceiver 12 or RFID transceiver 32 can send out signals along interconnection 18 to permanently modify or destroy integrated circuit (IC) 16 or integrated circuit (IC) 36 within a
period of time around when an indication of tampering or probing of semiconductor device 15 or packaging 14 is received by RFID device 10.  Alternatively, the receipt of a proper encoded signal 62 by RFID transceiver 12 or RFID transceiver 32 allows
access to integrated circuit (IC) 16 or integrated circuit (IC) 36 without modification or destruction.
<BR><BR>In one embodiment, if integrated circuit (IC) 16 or integrated circuit (IC) 36 or packaging 14 is opened or probed without RFID transceiver 12 or RFID transceiver 32 first receiving a proper encoded signal 32, either from user-specified RFID
reader 60 or nested RFID 70, integrated circuit (IC) 16 or integrated circuit (IC) 36 is either permanently or temporarily disabled in order to deter theft.
<BR><BR>In one embodiment, encoded signal 62 from RFID reader 60 or a nested RFID 70 can be used to signal RFID transceiver 12 to cause a change in the operation of integrated circuit (IC) 16 or integrated circuit (IC) 36 or an associated subsystem.  For
example, signal traces within integrated circuit (IC) 16 or integrated circuit (IC) 36 can be disabled or harmful voltages can be applied to integrated circuit (IC) 16 or integrated circuit (IC) 36 with the purpose of causing its destruction.  This mode
of operation can be similar to that described above for preventing probing or reverse engineering of integrated circuit (IC) 16 or integrated circuit (IC) 36, but can be carried out as a direct result of an authorized user or process command.
<BR><BR>In one embodiment, RFID systems 100, 200, 300, 400 or 500 can be used to locate, identify and track semiconductor device 15 items.  RFID devices 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 include a unique RFID address 64.  RFID address 64 can be communicated to RFID
reader 60 or nested RFID 70.  Processor 61 can process RFID address 64 for locating, identifying or tracking associated semiconductor device 15.
<BR><BR>In one embodiment, a long address, such as having a length of about 128 bytes, can be used for RFID transceiver 12 or RFID transceiver 32 to distinguish RFID transceiver 12 or RFID transceiver 32 from every other RFID.  Alternatively, RFID
transceiver 12 or RFID transceiver 32 can be located on a palette or inside an enclosure in which only a small number of RFIDs communicate with RFID reader 60 or nested RFID reader 70.  In this embodiment, the address of the internal RFID can be reduced. Accordingly, a lower cost RFID can use a shorter address.  However, to save cost, it is typically not desirable to make separate RFIDs with different address lengths.  In one embodiment, a growable address RFID can be used in which a plurality of RFID
transceivers 12 or RFID transceivers 32 can be associated in order to provide longer addresses.  As shown in FIG. 12, multiple RFIDs 12, referred to as RFIDs 80 and 81 having addresses 64 and 65, respectively, are placed together, each containing a
portion of the address.  Although each only contains a portion of the address, when located together, the combination of RFIDs only responds to the concatenated address of address 64 and 65.  Accordingly, only one type of RFID IC can be manufactured, but
by combining these RFIDs by putting two or more RFID circuits within a package, any length address RFID can be created.  Instead of the traditional linear address space, two RFIDs working in concert can create a two-dimensional address space, with the
potential address range equal to the square of a single device's address space.  In an alternate embodiment, it is possible to go beyond two RFIDs to grow the effective address space without practical limits.  This approach is feasible for two reasons:
first, due to high volume manufacturing and the embedding of RFIDs directly into other packages the incremental cost is very low; second, the low duty cycle and inherent ability to avoid RFID collisions in a multi-RFID environment allows multiple RFIDs
on one tracked item to respond independently to a probing signal.
<BR><BR>Placing RFID transceiver 12 or RFID transceiver 32 and respective antenna 42 or antenna 52 in the same packaging or as a block of integrated circuit (IC) 16 or integrated circuit (IC) 36 can create interference between the RFID transceiver 12 or
RFID transceiver 32 and integrated circuit (IC) 16 or integrated circuit (IC) 36.  This problem can be alleviated because the RFID signal is well defined and occurs only when RFID transceiver 12 is probed.  The RFID signal can be canceled on integrated
circuit (IC) 16 or integrated circuit (IC) 36, by correlating the known probe signal with any noise on integrated circuit (IC) 16 or integrated circuit (IC) 36 and canceling such correlation, or by scheduling the probe and response when integrated
circuit (IC) 16 or integrated circuit (IC) 36 is not active.  Similarly, the clock and interference from integrated circuit (IC) 16 or integrated circuit (IC) 36 into RFID transceiver 12 or RFID transceiver 32 IC is also well defined and can be canceled
or avoided.
<BR><BR>In an alternate embodiment, a plurality of RFID transceivers 12 can be embedded within packaging 76, as shown in FIG. 11.  This embodiment provides additional tracking possibilities taken separately or in conjunction, including tracking by
different entities, different companies, different security protocols and the like.
<BR><BR>ICs in devices are often located within shielded housings in the device, or multiple devices may be partially shielded within a larger group of devices, such as when they are on a palette.  In this case, it may be difficult to get a probe signal
to the RFID from the outside.  In addition, for security, one may not want to have all the RFIDs available to respond to any probe signal, which could then be used to identify all the RFIDs within a given area.  Therefore, a nested approach is used
whereby the RFIDs within an enclosure communicate only to an RFID located on the surface of that enclosure.  In this case the RFID would have an antenna located inside the enclosure to communicate to the RFIDs in the enclosure, as well as an antenna
outside the enclosure to communicate with an external reader.  The RFID on the enclosure could provide a higher degree of security (<B><I>encryption</I></B>) than those inside the enclosure, and there could be only a thin wire connecting through the enclosure for the
two antennas and RFID IC.  Thus, access to the RFIDs inside the enclosure would be restricted to the RFID on the enclosure, and much lower cost RFIDs could be used inside the enclosure.
<BR><BR>In all the above-described embodiments, the packaging cost of the RFID is eliminated as it is included with the packaging of the semiconductor, dramatically reducing the cost of implementing the RFID.  In the embodiments of the RFID transceiver
as a separate circuit block or independent circuit within the semiconductor device, additional circuitry cost of the RFID is nearly eliminated.
<BR><BR>Through re-use the cost of implementing RFID technology is shared by each device desired to be located, identified and tracked in the business process which opens the RFID benefits to stand-alone low value products and less voluminous, high value
products.
<BR><BR>It is to be understood that the above-described embodiments are illustrative of only a few of the many possible specific embodiments, which can represent applications of the principles of the invention.  Numerous and varied other arrangements can
be readily devised in accordance with these principles by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
