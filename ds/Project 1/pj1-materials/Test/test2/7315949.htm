Description</B></I></CENTER> <HR> <BR><BR>TECHNICAL FIELD
<BR><BR>The present invention generally relates to the field of portable electronic devices.  More particularly, the present invention relates to the field of personal digital assistants (PDAs) and other similar types of portable electronic devices.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND ART
<BR><BR>There have been many advances within genetic research, chemistry, biology, and fabrication processes.  Modern research and technology have also provided society with a wide variety of electronic devices.  It is appreciated that some of these
modern electronic devices are very powerful and useful to their users.  For example, some of the electronic devices which fall into this category include: computers which occupy large office space down to computers which are held in one's hand,
satellites which orbit around the earth relaying a multitude of communication signals, global positioning system (GPS) devices capable of determining the specific locations of their users on the earth, cellular phones which enable their users to
communicate wirelessly with other people, to name a few.  Additionally, it is also appreciated that some modern electronic devices also provide entertainment to their users.  For instance, some of the electronic devices which fall into this category
include: portable and fixed radio receivers which provide their users music along with a wide array of different audio programming, video game consoles which challenge their users with varying situations within different virtual realities, portable and
fixed compact disc (CD) players which provide music to their users, and televisions which provide a wide variety of visual and audio programming to their users.
<BR><BR>It is appreciated that many companies and businesses continuously strive to improve, develop, and discover new technologies.  However, these continuous efforts typically involve increased expenditures by the particular company or business. 
Additionally, when important research and development come to fruition, they become even more valuable to the developing company or business.  As such, the developing company or business is extremely interested in keeping their confidential research and
development protected from being easily acquired or stolen by other competing companies and businesses.
<BR><BR>There are a wide variety of ways a company or business may protect their valuable confidential research and development.  For example, when a company is transmitting confidential information over a public network (e.g., telephone network, the
Internet, etc.), they may utilize some type of <B><I>encryption</I></B> and decryption program in order to keep the information secure.  Furthermore, the company may install video cameras which are strategically placed throughout their corporate campus in order to
provide surveillance of certain buildings and/or highly restricted areas.  Moreover, the company may also hire security guards which check employee identification badges when an employee enters and/or exits corporate buildings and/or certain restricted
areas of a corporate building.  Additionally, the security guards may monitor specific activities occurring inside and outside of corporate buildings.
<BR><BR>Another way that a company may protect their valuable confidential research and development is to run background checks on prospective employees in order to determine if they present some type of potential security breach to the hiring company. 
A background check may include the accumulation of a wide variety of information about a prospective employee.  For example, a background check may include determining all of the previous employment of a prospective employee and talking with their
previous bosses in order to inquire whether the prospective employee ever caused any problems while working at those jobs.  Furthermore, the background check may include contacting city, state, and/or federal law enforcement agencies in order to
ascertain whether the prospective employee has any type of criminal record.  The background check may also include determining what organizations the prospective employee is currently a member of or has ever been a member of in the past.
<BR><BR>Additionally, another way that a company can protect their valuable confidential research and development is to restrict unauthorized people from having access to their corporate campuses, buildings, laboratories, and the like.  One of the
typical ways of doing this is to utilize a personal non-contact security keycard system to regulate the flow of people into these particular restricted areas.  The general idea of this type of system is that only those individuals with an authorized
security keycard are able to enter restricted areas.  Typically, these security keycards take the form of a badge about the size of a credit card which authorized personnel carry around with them in order to enter and/or exit different restricted areas
of a corporate campus and/or building.  These security keycards sometime include some type of clip device enabling the keycard to be attach to an authorized person's clothing.  However, another common way of enabling an authorized person to carrying
around his or her security keycard is to implement it with a necklace thereby enabling an authorized person to constantly wear the keycard around their neck.
<BR><BR>It should be appreciated that there are disadvantages associated with a non-contact keycard security system.  For example, one of the disadvantages is that a keycard is just another item which an authorized person has to carry with them as they
travel around a corporate campus or within different areas of a corporate building.  In other words, authorized personnel of a company or business typically find it undesirable to carry around more and more items with them.
<BR><BR>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>Accordingly, what is needed is a method and system for incorporating non-contact keycard technology into another device (e.g., personal digital assistant) that an authorized person typically carries around with them.  The present invention
provides this advantage and others which will no doubt become obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art after having read the following detailed description of embodiments in accordance with the present invention.
<BR><BR>For example, one embodiment in accordance with the present invention includes implementing a personal digital assistant (PDA) with a wireless personal identification mechanism.  Specifically, the wireless identification mechanism can be a radio
frequency identification (RFID) integrated circuit which is incorporated on the inside of the rear housing (e.g., plastic) of the personal digital assistant.  Once the radio frequency identification integrated circuit has been implemented with an
authorized security code, the personal digital assistant in accordance with the present embodiment is capable of functioning as a "key" enabling entry into restricted areas which are secured with non-contact radio frequency security systems such as
corporate campuses, buildings, and/or laboratories.  In this manner, an authorized person does not have to carry around a separate radio frequency keycard in order to gain access to restricted areas.

<BR><BR>Some portions of the detailed descriptions which follow are presented in terms of procedures, logic blocks, processing, and other symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory.  These descriptions and
representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art.  In the present application, a procedure, logic block, process, etc., is conceived to be
a self-consistent sequence of steps or instructions leading to a desired result.  The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities.  Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic
signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated in a computer system.  It has proved convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols,
characters, terms, numbers, or the like.
<BR><BR>It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities.  Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent
from the following discussions, it is appreciated that throughout the present invention, discussions utilizing terms such as "implementing", "installing", "outputting", "generating", "receiving", "unlocking", "transmitting", "determining", "using" or the
like, refer to the actions and processes of a computer system, or similar electronic device including a personal digital assistant (PDA).  The computer system or similar electronic computing device manipulates and transforms data represented as physical
(electronic) quantities within the computer system's registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage, transmission, or display devices. The present invention is also well suited to the use of other computer systems such as, for example, optical and mechanical computers.
<BR><BR>Referring now to FIG. 1, a system 50 that can be used in conjunction with the present invention is shown.  It is appreciated that the personal identification security system of the present invention can be used in conjunction with any personal

<BR><BR>PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION SECURITY SYSTEM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRESENT INVENTION
<BR><BR>With reference now to FIG. 6A, a perspective view of a personal identification security system 600 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown.  The personal identification security system 600 of the present embodiment
includes portable computing device 100w (e.g., personal digital assistant) implemented with a built-in radio frequency identification (RFID) tag or integrated circuit 602 (which is a personal identification security feature).  For example, the radio
frequency identification integrated circuit 602 is incorporated on the inside of the rear plastic housing 245 of personal digital assistant 100w.  However, radio frequency identification integrated circuit 602 of the present embodiment is well suited to
be incorporated with portable computing device 100w in many different ways.  Once an authorized security code is installed within the radio frequency identification integrated circuit 602, portable computing device 100w in accordance with the present
embodiment is capable of functioning as a "key" enabling entry into and/or exit from restricted areas which are secured with non-contact radio frequency security systems such as corporate campuses, buildings, and/or laboratories.  In this manner, an
authorized person does not have to carry around a separate radio frequency keycard in order to gain access to and/or exit from restricted areas.
<BR><BR>Within the present embodiment, radio frequency identification integrated circuit 602 includes a memory device 604 for storing one or more security codes and/or passwords (which may be unique and/or common).  Additionally, memory device 604 can
also store other information and data.  Furthermore, memory device 604 of the radio frequency identification tag 602 is flash memory, but may be implemented with many different types of memory devices in accordance with the present embodiment.  It is
understood that a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag or integrated circuit are well known by those of ordinary skill in the art.
<BR><BR>Referring still to FIG. 6A, it should be appreciated that the RFID integrated circuit 602 of the present embodiment may be optionally coupled to processor 101 (FIG. 5) of personal digital assistant 100w.  Implemented in this fashion, software
operating on processor 101 has the capability of keeping track of the time and date (for example) personal digital assistant 100w entered and/or exited a restricted area such as a building and/or laboratory.  In this manner, a personal log can be created
by software operating on personal digital assistant 100w thereby documenting its ingress and egress of restricted areas.  It is understood that when processor 101 is coupled to RFID integrated circuit 602, the present embodiment is well suited to
accommodate a wide variety of software and/or hardware implementations which operate in conjunction with the "key" functionality of portable computer system 100w.
<BR><BR>Portable computing device 100w of the present embodiment is well suited to be implemented as an extremely wide variety of devices.  For example, portable computing device 100w may be implemented as a portable telephone, portable laptop computer
system, personal digital assistant, pager, calculator, and the like.
<BR><BR>It should be appreciated that the authorized security code stored within memory device 604 of RFID tag 602 can be initially programmed and stored in a wide variety of ways.  For example, the RFID integrated circuit 602 may be placed in front of a
master programmer device which can erase and program memory device 604 with the proper authorized security code or password along with any other data and information that is desirable.  Furthermore, if RFID tag 602 is coupled to processor 101 of portable
computer system 100w, the authorized security code can be initially programmed and stored within memory device 604 by interfacing with the controls of portable computer system 100w.  Moreover, if RFID tag 602 is coupled to processor 101 of portable
computer system 100w, the authorized security code can be initially programmed and stored within memory device 604 via communication interface 108 of portable computer system 100w.
<BR><BR>FIG. 6B is a perspective view of a personal identification security system 650 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.  The personal identification security system 650 of the present embodiment includes RFID tag 602 as an
add-on feature to an existing portable computing device 100x (e.g., personal digital assistant).  For example, RFID integrated circuit 602 of the present embodiment is incorporated with a snap-on adapter 652 which is fabricated to couple (for example) to
the back of the existing portable computing device 100x.  Snap-on adapter 652 may be fabricated from a extremely wide variety of materials (e.g., plastic, nylon, carbon fiber, etc.) and in many different shapes in accordance with the present embodiment. 
The snap-on adapter 652 (in conjunction with RFID tag 602) is very thin (e.g., 2 millimeters) such that it does not significantly increase the overall thickness of portable computing device 100x.  In this manner, portable computing device 100x together
with snap-on adapter 652 operates in a manner similar to portable computer system 100w (FIG. 6A) which has a built-in RFID integrated circuit 602, as described above.  It should be appreciated that RFID tag 602 and memory device 604 of FIG. 6B are the
same components as RFID tag 602 and memory device 604 of FIG. 6A, described above.
<BR><BR>FIG. 7 illustrates a non-contact radio frequency security system 700 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention wherein portable computer device 100w and/or 100x may operate.  The non-contact radio frequency (RF) security system
700 is typically utilized to restrict unauthorized individuals from gaining access to a particular area (e.g., building, laboratory, etc.).  Specifically, when an authorized RF security code signal is received by a radio frequency (RF) reader device 702,
it causes an entryway locking mechanism 710 to temporarily unlock an entryway (not shown) enabling one or more people to pass through it.
<BR><BR>More specifically, RF reader device 702 continually outputs a RF signal field 704 which may have a range of a couple of feet.  It is appreciated that RFID integrated circuit 602 (FIGS. 6A and 6B) of portable computer devices 100w and 100x are
inactive except when located within a strong RF signal field such as RF signal field 704.  Therefore, when portable computer system 100w or 100x enters and is enveloped by RF signal field 704, RFID integrated circuit 602 picks up enough RF energy from RF
signal field 704 to cause it to become energized.  Once energized, RFID integrated circuit 602 outputs an RF signal 706.  Moreover, the RF signal 706 contains the security code and/or password which was previously stored within memory device 604 of RFID
integrated circuit 602.  In other words, RFID integrated circuit 602 automatically generates and broadcasts RF signal 706 which contains the security code.  Upon receiving RF signal 706, RF reader device 702 determines whether the received security code
of RF signal 706 has been authorized to enter the particular secured area.  If the security code is not an authorized security code, RF reader device 702 does not cause the entryway to be unlocked.  However, if RF reader device 702 determines the
security code of RF signal 706 is authorized, RF reader device 702 outputs a release signal 708 to entryway locking mechanism 710.  Upon receiving release signal 708, entryway locking mechanism 710 unlocks the entryway enabling one or more people to pass
through it.
<BR><BR>Therefore, portable computer systems 100w and 100x provide more convenience to their user.  For example, RFID tag 602 of portable computer system 100w or 100x is capable of operating while still in a pocket of its user.  As such, the user just
has to get RFID integrated circuit 602 close enough to RF reader device 702 in order to activate RFID integrated circuit 602.  Therefore, locking mechanism 710 will unlock the entryway and the user did not even have to remove portable computer system
100w or 100x from their pocket in order to enter a restricted area.  Another advantage of the present embodiment is that portable computer systems 100w and 100x may be utilized in conjunction with current RF keycard readers which are already installed at
different corporate campuses, buildings, and laboratories.
<BR><BR>FIG. 8 illustrates a non-contact infrared security system 800 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention wherein portable computer device 100y (e.g., personal digital assistant) can operate.  The non-contact infrared security
system 800 may be utilized to restrict unauthorized individuals from gaining access to a particular area such as a laboratory, building, and the like.  Specifically, when an authorized infrared security code signal is received by an infrared reader
device 804, it causes entryway locking mechanism 710 to temporarily unlock an entryway (not shown) enabling one or more individuals to pass through it.  Portable computer device 100y is implemented with software in accordance with the present embodiment
which enables it to output an infrared signal 802 containing an authorized security code via infrared communication mechanism 64.  As such, portable computer system 100y has the capability of functioning as a "key" enabling entry into restricted areas
which are secured with non-contact infrared security system 800.
<BR><BR>Specifically, in order to utilize portable computer system 100y as a "key" for non-contact infrared security system 800, infrared communication mechanism 64 of portable computer system 100y is pointed at infrared reader device 804 and then
activated to output infrared signal 802 containing an authorized security password or code (which may be unique and/or common).  Upon receiving infrared signal 802, infrared reader device 804 determines whether the security code contained within infrared
signal 802 is an authorized security code.  If the security code is not an authorized security code, infrared reader device 804 does not cause the entryway to be unlocked.  Conversely, if infrared reader 804 determines that the received security code of
infrared signal 802 is authorized, infrared reader 804 outputs release signal 708 to entryway locking mechanism 710.  Upon receiving release signal 708, entryway locking mechanism 710 unlocks the entryway enabling one or more individuals to pass through
it.
<BR><BR>As such, the personal identification security feature of portable computing device 100y includes infrared communication mechanism 64 along with software programming for controlling the transmission of infrared signal 802.
<BR><BR>Referring to FIG. 8, it should be appreciated that the authorized security code or password output with infrared signal 802 is stored within a memory device (e.g., volatile memory unit 102, non-volatile memory unit 103, etc.) of portable
computing device 100y.  Furthermore, the authorized security code of infrared signal 802 can be initially programmed and stored within a memory device(s) in a wide variety of ways.  For example, the authorized security code can be initially programmed
and stored within a memory device of portable computer system 100y by interfacing with the controls of portable computer system 100y.  Additionally, the authorized security code can be initially programmed and stored within a memory device of portable
computer system 100y via communication interface 108 of portable computer system 100y.
<BR><BR>It is appreciated that personal digital assistant 100y of the present embodiment utilizes processor 101 while functioning as a "key" within non-contact infrared security system 800.  As such, additional software operating on processor 101 is
capable of keeping track of the time and date (for example) personal digital assistant 100y enters and/or exits a restricted area such as a laboratory and/or building.  In this manner, a personal log may be created by software operating on personal
digital assistant 100y documenting its ingress and egress of restricted areas.  It is understood that the present embodiment is well suited to accommodate a wide variety of software and/or hardware implementations which operate in conjunction with the
"key" functionality of personal digital assistant 100y.
<BR><BR>Within FIG. 8, it should be appreciated that portable computing device 100y of the present embodiment is well suited to be implemented as an extremely wide variety of devices.  For example, portable computing device 100y may be implemented as a
portable telephone, portable laptop computer system, personal digital assistant, pager, calculator, and the like.
<BR><BR>FIG. 9 illustrates a docking station security system 900 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention wherein portable computer device 100z (e.g., personal digital assistant) may operate.  The docking station security system 900 may
be utilized to restrict unauthorized individuals from gaining access to a particular area such as a building, laboratory, and the like.  Specifically, when an authorized security code signal is received by a security reader device 904 via a docking
station (e.g., cradle 60a), it causes entryway locking mechanism 710 to temporarily unlock an entryway (not shown) enabling one or more people to pass through it.  Portable computer device 100z is implemented with software in accordance with the present
embodiment which enables it to output a signal 902 containing an authorized security code via communication interface 108 (FIG. 2B) when coupled to cradle 60a.  As such, portable computer system 100z is capable of functioning as a "key" thereby enabling
entry into restricted areas which are secured with docking station security system 900.
<BR><BR>As described above, cradle 60a contains a mechanical and electrical interface 260 for interfacing with serial communication interface 108 of portable computer system 100z when system 100z is slid into the cradle 60a in an upright position.  Once
inserted, button 270 can be pressed to initiate two way communication between portable computer system 100z and a security reader device 904.  During this communication, portable computing device 100z outputs signal 902 containing an authorized security
code or password (which may be unique and/or common) which is received by cradle 60a.  Subsequently, cradle 60a outputs signal 902 containing the security code to security reader device 904.  Upon receiving signal 902, security reader device 904
determines whether the security code of signal 902 is an authorized security code.  If the security code is not an authorized security code, security reader device 904 does not cause the entryway to be unlocked.  However, if security reader device 904
determines that the received security code of signal 902 is authorized, security reader device 904 outputs release signal 708 to entryway locking mechanism 710.  Upon receiving release signal 708, entryway locking mechanism 710 unlocks the entryway
enabling one or more people to pass through it.
<BR><BR>Therefore, the personal identification security feature of portable computing device 100z includes serial communication interface 108 along with software programming for controlling the transmission of signal 902 via communication interface 108.
<BR><BR>Referring still to FIG. 9, it should be appreciated that the authorized security code or password output with signal 902 is stored within a memory device (e.g., volatile memory unit 102, non-volatile memory unit 103, etc.) of portable computing
device 100z.  Additionally, the authorized security code of signal 902 can be initially programmed and stored within a memory device(s) in a wide variety of ways.  For example, the authorized security code can be initially programmed and stored within a
memory device of portable computer system 100z by interfacing with the controls of portable computer system 100z.  Moreover, the authorized security code can be initially programmed and stored within a memory device of portable computer system 100z via
communication interface 108 of portable computer system 100z.
<BR><BR>It is understood that personal digital assistant 100z of the present embodiment utilizes processor 101 while functioning as a "key" within docking station security system 900.  Therefore, additional software operating on processor 101 has the
capability of keeping track of the time and date (for example) personal digital assistant 100z enters and/or exits a restricted area such as a building and/or laboratory.  In this manner, a personal log may be created by software operating on personal
digital assistant 100z documenting its ingress and egress of restricted areas.  It is appreciated that the present embodiment is well suited to accommodate a wide variety of software and/or hardware implementations which operate in conjunction with the
"key" functionality of personal digital assistant 100z.
<BR><BR>Within FIG. 9, it is understood that portable computing device 100z of the present embodiment is well suited to be implemented as an extremely wide variety of devices.  For example, portable computing device 100z may be implemented as a portable
telephone, portable laptop computer system, personal digital assistant, pager, calculator, and the like.
<BR><BR>FIG. 10 illustrates a flowchart 1000 of steps performed in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention for enabling a portable computing device to be utilized in conjunction with a personal identification security system.  Flowchart
1000 includes processes of the present invention which, in one embodiment, are carried out by a processor and electrical components under the control of computer readable and computer executable instructions.  Some or all of the computer readable and
computer executable instructions may reside, for example, in data storage features such as computer usable volatile memory unit 102 and/or computer usable non-volatile memory unit 103 of FIG. 5.  However, the computer readable and computer executable
instructions may reside in any type of computer readable medium.  Although specific steps are disclosed in flowchart 1000, such steps are exemplary.  That is, the present invention is well suited to performing various other steps or variations of the
steps recited in FIG. 10.  Within the present embodiment, it should be appreciated that the steps of flowchart 1000 can be performed by software or hardware or any combination of software and hardware.
<BR><BR>The general idea of flowchart 1000 is to install a personal identification security feature with a portable computing device (e.g., personal digital assistant).  Once the personal identification security feature has been installed with an
authorized security code, the portable computing device is capable of functioning as a "key" enabling entry into restricted areas which are secured with locking security systems such as corporate campuses, buildings, and/or laboratories.  In this manner,
an authorized person does not have to carry around a separate "key" in order to gain access to restricted areas.
<BR><BR>At step 1002 of FIG. 10, the present embodiment installs a personal identification security feature with a portable computing device (e.g., 100).  Within the present embodiment, the personal identification security feature is well suited to be
implemented in a wide variety of different ways.  For example, the personal identification security feature may include a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag or integrated circuit (e.g., 602).  Furthermore, the personal identification security
feature of the present embodiment may include a wireless transmitter (e.g., infrared communication mechanism 64) along with software programming for controlling the transmission of wireless (e.g., infrared) communication signals.  Additionally, the
personal identification security feature may include a wired communication interface (e.g., serial port, parallel port, and the like) together with software programming for controlling the transmission of communication signals.  Moreover, the portable
computing device of the present embodiment is well suited to be a wide variety of devices.  For example, the portable computing device may include a portable laptop computer system, personal digital assistant, pager, portable communication device,
calculator, and the like.
<BR><BR>In step 1004, the present embodiment installs an authorized security code and/or password (which may be unique and/or common) with the personal identification security feature.  For example, an authorized security code is stored within a memory
device (e.g., 604) of a RFID tag (e.g., 602).  Additionally, an authorized security code is stored within a memory device of the portable computing device.  At step 1006, the present embodiment selectively transmits the authorized security code.  It is
appreciated that the authorized security code may be output in a wide variety of ways in accordance with the present embodiment.  For example, the authorized security code may be output via wireless communication (e.g., radio frequency, infrared, etc.)
and/or wired communication (e.g., serial port, parallel port, and the like).
<BR><BR>At step 1008 of FIG. 10, the present embodiment determines whether a security code has been received.  If the present embodiment determines that a security code has not been received during step 1008, the present embodiment proceeds to the
beginning of step 1008.  However, if the present embodiment determines that a security code has been received during step 1008, the present embodiment proceeds to step 1010.  In step 1010, the present embodiment determines whether the received security
code is an authorized security code.  If the present embodiment determines that the received security code is not an authorized security code during step 1010, the present embodiment proceeds to the beginning of step 1008.  Conversely, if the present
embodiment determines that the received security code is an authorized security code during step 1010, the present embodiment proceeds to step 1012.
<BR><BR>In step 1012, the present embodiment temporarily releases a locking mechanism of an entrance of a restricted area.  In this manner, one or more individuals are able to gain access to the restricted area via the unlocked entrance.  It should be
appreciated that the amount of time the entrance is temporarily unlock during step 1012 is not limited to any particular amount of time.  That is, the present embodiment is well suited to temporarily unlock the entrance for any amount of time.  Upon the
completion of step 1012, the present embodiment proceeds to the beginning of step 1008.
<BR><BR>Accordingly, the present invention provides a method and system for incorporating non-contact keycard technology into another device (e.g., personal digital assistant, portable telephone, pager, calculator, etc.) that an authorized person
typically carries around with them.
<BR><BR>The foregoing descriptions of specific embodiments of the present invention have been presented for purposes of illustration and description.  They are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed, and
obviously many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching.  The embodiments were chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the invention and its practical application, to thereby enable others skilled
in the art to best utilize the invention and various embodiments with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated.  It is intended that the scope of the invention be defined by the claims appended hereto and their equivalents.
