<P>An apparatus and method for unifying multiple radio frequency
     identifications (RFIDs) are provided. The apparatus includes: a data
     arithmetic operator collecting RFIDs, storing the collected RFIDs, and
     repeatedly performing the collection and storage when a time out event
     occurs; a hash arithmetic operator concatenating the RFIDs, hashing the
     concatenated RFIDs, and outputting a hashed single value; a random number
     generator generating a random number used as an <B><I>encryption</I></B> factor to
     public-key-encrypt the single value; an <B><I>RFID</I></B> tag processor controlling
     locking/unlocking of the <B><I>RFID</I></B> tags; a public key arithmetic operator
     public-key-encrypting the single value using a predetermined public key
     and the random number as <B><I>encryption</I></B> factors and outputting a <B><I>cipher</I></B> text;
     and a radio frequency communicator converting the <B><I>cipher</I></B> text into a
     radio signal and sending the radio signal to a radio section. Information
     transmitted to a radio section is a <B><I>cipher</I></B> text obtained by
     public-key-encrypting the single value. Therefore, the number of the <B><I>RFID</I></B>
     tags belonging to a user is not exposed to an eavesdropper, thereby
     protecting user's privacy.

<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>1.  Field of the Invention
<BR><BR>The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for unifying multiple radio frequency identification (RFID) tags as a single encrypted value and a user privacy protection method using the single value, more particularly, to an apparatus
and method for unifying identifiers of multiple RFID tags that belong to a user and encrypting the unified identifiers using a public key by which the user is recognized to have a single encrypted radio frequency identifier, and for protecting privacy of
the user that owns the multiple RFID tags.
<BR><BR>2.  Description of the Related Art
<BR><BR>Conventional user privacy protection methods are classified into kill tag methods and blocker tag methods that prevent radio frequency identification (RFID) of a user from being read.  The kill tag methods inactivate an RFID tag including a
password when the same password as the password of the RFID tag and a kill command are received from a reader.  The RFID tag including a circuit that could be shorted is dead when the circuit is short.  There is no method to restore the dead RFID tag. 
The blocker tag methods have a different operating principle according to collision avoidance systems.  In a binary tree-walking system, the user owns a separate blocker tag that consistently responds yes or no to all inquiry messages of the reader so
that the reader is confused due to actual information of the user.  In a slot aloha system, the reader is confused due to a separate blocker tag that responds to all slots and causes collision.  Also, unlike the blocker tag methods, a method of
encrypting RFID prevents an eavesdropper from exactly understanding information.
<BR><BR>However, when an authentic reader attempts to read belongings of the user, for example, an authorized legal institution having a search right such as the Exit and Entry Control Bureau searches for belongings of a passenger, the authentic reader
cannot find RFIDs of the belongings of the passenger using the kill and blocker tag methods.  Also, although the eavesdropper reads an encrypted RFID and cannot exactly understand content included therein, the eavesdropper can acquire the number of RFID
tags owned by the user, and use the encrypted value of RFID to track a movement route of the user.  If valuables, money, securities, etc. use the RFID encrypting method, the number of RFID tags of the valuables, money, securities, etc. is exposed and the
RFID tags are illegally tracked, which may infringe user's privacy.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>The present invention will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which exemplary embodiments of the invention are shown.
<BR><BR>FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an apparatus for unifying multiple radio frequency identifications (RFID) according to an embodiment of the present invention.  The apparatus is referred to as a "single value tag" or a "blackout tag".  Referring to
FIG. 1, the apparatus comprises a data arithmetic operator 160, a hash arithmetic operator 140, a random number generator 120, a random number timer 130, a public key arithmetic operator 110, an RFID tag processor 170, a release timer 150, and a radio
frequency communicator 180.
<BR><BR>The operation of the constituents will now be in detail described.  The data arithmetic operator 160 collects RFIDs of RFID tags belonging to a user and stores the collected RFIDs.  Since all the RFID tags of the user excluding the apparatus are
made in a lock mode, when the data arithmetic operator 160 receives an RFID request command from a single value reader illustrated in FIG. 2, it transmits the RFIDs stored in the apparatus to the single value reader.  The data arithmetic operator 160
must encrypt response data using a symmetry key to protect the RFIDs to be transmitted to the single value reader, and can use a single value created by the hash arithmetic operator 140 as an <B><I>encryption</I></B> key.
<BR><BR>The hash arithmetic operator 140 creates the single value by concatenating the RFIDs collected by the data arithmetic operator 160 and hashing the combination value.  The concatenating means a sequential enumeration of the RFIDs.
<BR><BR>The random number generator 120 generates a random number used as an <B><I>encryption</I></B> factor to encrypt the single value using a public key.  If the RFID tags belonging to the user are not added or removed for a long time, it means that the single
value remains for that time.  Therefore, when a public key value and encrypted data are identical to each other, the RFIDs can be tracked by an eavesdropper because of the same <B><I>cipher</I></B> text.  To prevent the RFIDs from being tracked, a public key algorithm
that uses the public key value and the random number as <B><I>encryption</I></B> factors is used in the present invention.  The random number generator 120 generates the random number to be used as the <B><I>encryption</I></B> factor.  An example of the public key algorithm that
uses the random number as the <B><I>encryption</I></B> factor is an El Gamal algorithm.
<BR><BR>The random number timer 130 notifies an effective period of the random number.  Although the public key value and the encrypted data are identical to each other for a long time, since the random number is periodically changed and a new <B><I>cipher</I></B>
text is generated, the random number timer 130 is a time when to change the random number.
<BR><BR>The public key arithmetic operator 110 public-key-encrypts the single value created by the hash arithmetic operator 140 using a public key of an authorized institute that owns the single value reader and the random number generated by the random
number generator 120 as <B><I>encryption</I></B> factors.  A <B><I>cipher</I></B> text obtained by public-key-encrypting the single value is an RF signal that is transmitted to a radio section.  Therefore, the single value reader of the authorized institute having a private key
corresponding to the public key can decrypt the <B><I>cipher</I></B> text and restore the single value.
<BR><BR>The RFID tag processor 170 locks the RFID tags belonging to the user and releases the locked RFID tags.  The RFID tags are locked after the data arithmetic operator 160 collects the RFIDs of the user.  The RFID tags belonging to the user are
locked after the RFIDs are notified of the apparatus so that the RFIDs themselves cannot be externally notified.  The RFIDs belonging to the user can be notified when the user personally releases the locked RFID tags, or the authorized institute having a
private key corresponding to the public key requests the RFIDs collected by the apparatus.
<BR><BR>The release timer 150 notifies a timeout event to release the locked RFID tags after a predetermined time passes.  If an RFID tag belonging to a user is permanently locked, and is assigned to another user, another user cannot read the permanently
locked RFID tag.  To read the permanently locked RFID tag, the permanently locked RFID tag is released after the predetermined time passes.  The RFID tag can be locked and released without an intervention of the user.
<BR><BR>The apparatus for unifying multiple RFIDs of the current embodiment of the present invention manages a locking continued time of the RFIDs of the user using the release timer 150.  For example, if the release timer 150 is set to repeatedly lock
the RFID tags and release the locked RFID tags every sixty seconds, and an effective time of sixty seconds is notified of the RFID tags, when the user's RFID tags remain unchanged, the RFID tag processor 170 repeatedly releases and locks the RFID tags
every sixty seconds.  If the whole or some of the RFID tags are assigned to another user, since the assigned RFID tags are released after sixty seconds pass, a right to manage the RFID tags can be automatically assigned without an intervention of the
previous or new user.
<BR><BR>The radio frequency communicator 180 is responsible for the communication in a radio section.  The radio frequency communicator 180 transmits/receives data and control signals to/from outside, thereby collecting the RFID tags, transmitting lock
and release signals of the RFID tags and the <B><I>cipher</I></B> text of the single value, requesting the RFIDs of the single value reader, and transmitting response data to the request.
<BR><BR>FIG. 2 is a block diagram of the single value reader 200 according to an embodiment of the present invention.  Referring to FIG. 2, the single value reader 200 comprises an arithmetic operator 210, a private key decryption operator 220, and a
radio communicator 230.
<BR><BR>The private key decryption operator 220 decrypts a public key <B><I>cipher</I></B> text transmitted from the apparatus for unifying multiple RFIDs using its own private key and restores a single value.
<BR><BR>The arithmetic operator 210 obtains RFIDs belonging to a user.  That is, the arithmetic operator 210 requests RFIDs stored in the apparatus and receives the RFIDs.  To verify the single value reader 200 to be authentic, the arithmetic operator
210 does not transmit request data as a plain text but a symmetry key <B><I>cipher</I></B> text that can be understood by the apparatus.  The <B><I>encryption</I></B> key is the single value restored by the private key decryption operator 220.  Because the apparatus does not
respond to a non-encrypted request such that the single value reader 200 can be authenticated.  Also, the apparatus encrypts the RFIDs in response to the request, thereby protecting the RFIDs from being eavesdropped.
<BR><BR>The radio communicator 230 is a path of the data and control signals communicated between the apparatus and the single value reader 200.  The radio communicator 230 receives the <B><I>cipher</I></B> text obtained by public-key-encrypting the single value,
sends the received <B><I>cipher</I></B> text to the private key decryption operator 220, sends an RFID request command, and transfers response data to the request.
<BR><BR>FIG. 3 is a flowchart illustrating a method of unifying multiple RFIDs according to an embodiment of the present invention.  FIGS. 4A and 4B are flowcharts illustrating a user privacy protection method using an apparatus for unifying multiple
RFIDs and a single value reader according to an embodiment of the present invention.  FIG. 5 is a block diagram of a frame used to transmit RFIDs according to an embodiment of the present invention.
<BR><BR>Referring to FIG. 3, an apparatus for unifying multiple RFIDs collects RFIDs of multiple RFID tags, concatenates the collected RFIDs, hashes the concatenated RFIDs, and generates a single value in Operation S310.  The apparatus for unifying
multiple RFIDs generates a random number, public-key-encrypts the hashed single value using a public key and the random number as <B><I>encryption</I></B> factors, and transmits a <B><I>cipher</I></B> text obtained by public-key-encrypting the single value to a radio section in
Operation S320.  The apparatus for unifying multiple RFIDs receives an RFID transmission request message from a single value reader that received the <B><I>cipher</I></B> text and determines whether the RFID transmission request message is authentic.  If the RFID
transmission request message is determined to be authentic, the apparatus for unifying multiple RFIDs symmetry-key-encrypts the RFIDs using the single value as an <B><I>encryption</I></B> key, and transmits the symmetry-key-encrypted RFIDs to the single value reader
in Operation S330.  After standing by for a while, the apparatus for unifying multiple RFIDs resumes its operation when receiving an RFID transmission request from the single value reader.  The operation will now be described with reference to FIGS. 4A
and 4B.
<BR><BR>Referring to FIGS. 4A and 4B, the apparatus for unifying multiple RFIDs collects RFIDs belonging to a user and stores the collected RFIDs in Operation S401.  For example, If RFIDs of ten RFID tags are ID1, ID2, ID3, ID4, ID5, ID6, ID7, ID8, ID9,
and ID10, the data arithmetic operator 160 of the apparatus for unifying multiple RFIDs collects the ten RFIDs and stores the collected RFIDs.
<BR><BR>The apparatus for unifying multiple RFIDs locks the RFID tags belonging to the user in Operation S402.
<BR><BR>The apparatus for unifying multiple RFIDs operates a release timer to release the locked RFID tags after a predetermined time passes in Operation S403.  This will be in detail described later.
<BR><BR>The apparatus for unifying multiple RFIDs concatenates the collected RFIDs, hashes the collected RFIDs, and generates a single value in Operation S405 if the release timer is not timeout in Operation S404.  The hashed single value can be
expressed as below.
<BR><BR>H_ID=Hash(ID1 .parallel.  ID2 .parallel.  ID3 .parallel.  ID4 .parallel.  ID5 .parallel.  ID6 .parallel.  ID7 .parallel.  ID8 .parallel.  ID9 .parallel.  ID10).
<BR><BR>H_ID denotes the single value and is used as an <B><I>encryption</I></B> key for symmetry-ley-encrypting/decrypting an RFID request and response data.  The apparatus for unifying multiple RFIDs generates a random number used as an <B><I>encryption</I></B> factor to
public-key-encrypt the single key in Operation S406.  The random number is expressed as R.
<BR><BR>The apparatus for unifying multiple RFIDs operates a random number timer to reproduce the random number after a predetermined time passes in Operation S407.  The operation relating to a timeout of the random number timer will be described later.
<BR><BR>The apparatus for unifying multiple RFIDs public-key-encrypts the single value in Operation S409 if the random number timer is not timeout in Operation S408.  A public key <B><I>encryption</I></B> algorithm used by the apparatus for unifying multiple RFIDs is
an El Gamal algorithm.  The El Gamal algorithm uses the public key and a separate <B><I>encryption</I></B> factor to generate <B><I>cipher</I></B> text.  The El Gamal algorithm uses seven parameters, i.e., a generator g, a public key y, a <B><I>cipher</I></B> text 1 a, a <B><I>cipher</I></B> text 2 b, a
private key x, a plain text message m, and an <B><I>encryption</I></B> factor r.
<BR><BR>[Encryption Operation of the El Gamal Algorithm]
<BR><BR>x: the private key generated where the <B><I>encryption</I></B> operation is performed
<BR><BR>r: the <B><I>encryption</I></B> factor generated where the <B><I>encryption</I></B> operation is performed
<BR><BR>y=g.sup.x: the public key obtained by exponent-multiplying the generator by the private key
<BR><BR>a=g.sup.r: the <B><I>cipher</I></B> text 1 obtained by exponent-multiplying the generator by the <B><I>encryption</I></B> factor
<BR><BR>b=my.sup.r: the <B><I>cipher</I></B> text 2 obtained by multiplying the plain text message by the value obtained by exponent-multiplying the public key by the <B><I>encryption</I></B> factor
<BR><BR>In detail, although the private key, the public key, and the plain text message remain unchanged for a long time, the externally published <B><I>cipher</I></B> texts 1 and 2 have a different value due to a different <B><I>encryption</I></B> factor.
<BR><BR>[Decryption Operation of the El Gamal Algorithm] b=my.sup.r m=b/y.sup.r=b/(g.sup.x).sup.r=b/(g.sup.r).sup.x=b/a.sup.x
<BR><BR>a and b are public and a.sup.x can be obtained when the private key x is known, and thus m can be restored.
<BR><BR>The <B><I>encryption</I></B> operation and Operation S405 can be expressed as below.
<BR><BR><B><I>Cipher</I></B> text 1: a=g.sup.r
<BR><BR><B><I>Cipher</I></B> text 2: b=H_IDy.sup.r
<BR><BR>The apparatus for unifying multiple RFIDs sends the public-key-encrypted <B><I>cipher</I></B> text to the radio section and stands by in Operation S410.  Operations S401, S402, S403, S405, S406, S407, S409, and S410 are performed using the apparatus for
unifying multiple RFIDs.
<BR><BR>The reception operation of the single value reader will now be described.  The single value reader receives the <B><I>cipher</I></B> text sent to the radio section in Operation S411.
<BR><BR>The single value reader decrypts the received <B><I>cipher</I></B> text using the private key and obtains the single value in Operation S412.  The decryption operation is expressed as below.
<BR><BR><B><I>Cipher</I></B> text 1: a=g.sup.r
<BR><BR><B><I>Cipher</I></B> text 2: b=H_IDy.sup.r
<BR><BR>Restored single value: H_ID=b/y.sup.r=b/(g.sup.x).sup.r=b/(g.sup.r).sup.x=b/a.sup.x
<BR><BR>The single value reader requests the apparatus for unifying multiple RFIDs to send RFIDs belonging to the user in Operation S413.  The single value reader transmits a <B><I>cipher</I></B> text obtained by symmetry-key-encrypting response data using the
restored single value H_ID as the <B><I>encryption</I></B> key to the apparatus for unifying multiple RFIDs.  The present invention recommends the advanced <B><I>encryption</I></B> standard (AES) as a symmetry key algorithm.  If the length of the single value is not the same as
that of an <B><I>encryption</I></B> key of the AES, it is provided that both lengths are modified to be identical to each other under the agreement of the single value reader and the apparatus for unifying multiple RFIDs.
<BR><BR>The apparatus for unifying multiple RFIDs receives the <B><I>cipher</I></B> text transmitted by the single value reader in Operation S421, decrypts the <B><I>cipher</I></B> text using its own single value as the <B><I>encryption</I></B> key, and authenticates that the <B><I>cipher</I></B> text is an
RFID request command.  If the <B><I>cipher</I></B> text is not the RFID request command, the apparatus for unifying multiple RFIDs disregards the RFID request command in Operation S414.
<BR><BR>The apparatus for unifying multiple RFIDs transmits the RFIDs stored in the data arithmetic operator 160 to the single value reader according to the RFID request command in Operation S415.  Since the RFIDs have a different length based on the
standard, each of the RFIDs includes indexes 501, 511, and 591, lengths 502, 512, and 592, and RFIDs 503, 513, and 593, respectively, as illustrated in FIG. 5.  Also, the apparatus for unifying multiple RFIDs transmits a <B><I>cipher</I></B> text obtained by
symmetry-key-encrypting the RFIDs using its own single value H_ID as the <B><I>encryption</I></B> key to the single value reader in Operation S422.
<BR><BR>The single value reader receiving the <B><I>cipher</I></B> text transmitted from the apparatus for unifying multiple RFIDs decrypts the <B><I>cipher</I></B> text using the single value H_ID as the <B><I>encryption</I></B> key, and authenticates the RFIDs belonging to the user in
Operation S416.  Since the decrypted data is a message illustrated in FIG. 5, the single value reader can identify the total number of the RFIDs and individual RFIDs even if the RFIDs have a different length.
<BR><BR>The single value reader recognizes the RFIDs and transmits a success message in Operation S423 indicating that the RFIDs are completely received in Operation S417 to the apparatus for unifying multiple RFIDs.
<BR><BR>If the apparatus for unifying multiple RFIDs receives the success message in Operation S418, it completes a user privacy protection process.  If the apparatus for unifying multiple RFIDs fails receiving the success message in Operation S418, it
performs Operation S415 again.
<BR><BR>The operation of the release timer 150 will now be described.  After Operation S403 is performed, if a time out event occurs in the release timer 150 in Operation S404, the apparatus for unifying multiple RFIDs performs Operation S401 again in
order to detect a change in ownership of the RFID tags belonging to the user.  If the RFID tags are assigned to another user, a <B><I>cipher</I></B> text of single value to be transmitted to the radio section is accordingly changed.  The apparatus for unifying
multiple RFIDs periodically collects RFIDs and generates a single value to respond to the change in ownership of the RFID tags based on the operation of the release timer 150.
<BR><BR>The operation of the random number timer 130 will now be described.  After Operation S407 is performed, if the time out event occurs in the random number timer 130 in Operation S408, the apparatus for unifying multiple RFIDs performs the
generation of the random number in Operation S406 again.  A random number is used as an <B><I>encryption</I></B> factor in Operation S409, thereby modifying the <B><I>cipher</I></B> text sent to the radio section in Operation S420.  The <B><I>cipher</I></B> texts 1 and 2 can be expressed using
equations in Operation S409 below.
<BR><BR><B><I>Cipher</I></B> text 1: a'=g.sup.r'
<BR><BR><B><I>Cipher</I></B> text 2: b'=H_IDy.sup.r'
<BR><BR>The ownership of the RFID tags belonging to the user remains unchanged for a long time, resulting in no change in the single value.  Although a key value is not changed, the <B><I>encryption</I></B> factor is periodically changed, thereby generating a new
<B><I>cipher</I></B> text and transmitting the <B><I>cipher</I></B> text to the radio section.  The time out events of the release timer 150 and the random number timer 130 result in a change in the <B><I>cipher</I></B> text of the single value transmitted to the radio section, it is difficult
to determine whether the ownership of the RFID tags belonging to the user is changed even though the <B><I>cipher</I></B> text is eavesdropped.  Also, the user does not transmit the same <B><I>cipher</I></B> text every time, thereby preventing the user from being illegally tracked.
<BR><BR>The present invention can also be embodied as computer readable code on a computer readable recording medium.  The computer readable recording medium is any data storage device that can store data which can be thereafter read by a computer
system.  Examples of the computer readable recording medium include read-only memory (ROM), random-access memory (RAM), CD-ROMs, magnetic tapes, floppy disks, optical data storage devices, and carrier waves.  The computer readable recording medium can
also be distributed over network coupled computer systems so that the computer readable code is stored and executed in a distributed fashion.
<BR><BR>The present invention unifies RFIDs of multiple RFID tags as a single encrypted value.  The effect of the present invention is addressed as follows:
<BR><BR>First, the apparatus for unifying the RFIDs transmits information to a radio section.  The information is a <B><I>cipher</I></B> text obtained by public-key-encrypting the single value.  Therefore, the number of the RFID tags belonging to a user is not exposed
to an eavesdropper, thereby protecting user's privacy.
<BR><BR>Second, the information is a value that is changed always or periodically according to changes in the RFID tags belonging to the user.  Therefore, the eavesdropper cannot track the RFID tags, thereby protecting user's privacy.
<BR><BR>Third, the <B><I>cipher</I></B> text is encrypted using a public key of an authorized institute having a single value reader so that it can be decrypted by the single value reader having a private key corresponding to the public key, thereby preventing the
eavesdropper from obtaining information from the <B><I>cipher</I></B> text and protecting the user's privacy, and acquiring information on the RFIDs belonging to the user by the authorized institute when public profit and security are required.
<BR><BR>Fourth, the apparatus and method for unifying the multiple RFIDs are not limited to a specific collision avoidance system so that they can be applied to conventional slotted aloha and binary tree-walking systems, and various collision avoidance
systems.
<BR><BR>While the present invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein
without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the following claims.
