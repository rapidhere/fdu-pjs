<BR><BR>The present embodiments are detailed below with reference to the listed Figures.
<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS
<BR><BR>Before explaining the present embodiments in detail, it is to be understood that the embodiments are not limited to the particular embodiments and that they can be practiced or carried out in various ways.
<BR><BR>One advantage of the present method is that the present method is able to efficiently and quickly identify well equipment and other items transported in a shipping device and verify the presence of the items at intervals during transport.  This
method enables products to be processed rapidly through customs checkpoints, saving time and related shipping costs because of the ease of access of the data and the ability of the conjunctive use of a smart controller with encoded radio frequency
identification tags to verify continuously the presence of and, optionally, specifications of the well equipment.
<BR><BR>The present method enables the detection of any deviation of one or more pieces of well equipment being transported from a predetermined trip plan.  The present method allows for the detection and prevention of tampering, unauthorized or illegal
use, loss, or theft of any transported items, saving the time and costs associated with lost assets.
<BR><BR>The present method can also save lives and prevent property damage.  For example, a terrorist may attempt to destroy a well site by tampering with equipment during transport, and the tampering can be detected using the present method. 
Additionally, a terrorist attempt to destroy a drilling rig offshore, such as by planting explosives, can be detected and prevented through use of the present method to monitor the progress of well equipment during transport.
<BR><BR>The present method additionally can utilize reusable radio frequency identification tags which can be encoded with information, then removed for future use once a piece of well equipment reaches its destination.  Thus, the costs associated with
the present method and all required materials are relatively inexpensive, and "environmentally friendly" while being extremely effective and efficient.
<BR><BR>The present embodiments relate to a method for continuous asset verification using at least one radio frequency identification tag such as an iQ8 Active Tag, made by Identec Solutions of Toronto, Canada, for at least one piece of well equipment

suppression equipment, and other similar equipment.  Logging equipment, which can include radioactive sources, is also contemplated for enhanced security and protection through use of the present method.
<BR><BR>As part of the method, information about the well equipment and other information relating to one or more pieces of well equipment to be transported is written into a transportable data storage device, such as a jump drive having sufficient
storage, using a first processor.  Other information can include a work order number, a job site address, the name of a foreman to receive an order, or similar shipping information.  The information can also include freight forwarder information and
other transport information, such as a planned route, email notification lists, shipment criticality level, which indicates the priority code of the shipment--high, medium, low, or some other level, an average speed of travel, expected time of arrival,
name of driver, name of trucking company, serial number of truck or ship, or registration number or other identification of the truck or ship.
<BR><BR>The transportable data storage device can be an external memory storage device, such as a universal serial bus memory stick, an internal memory storage device, such as a computer hard drive, or combinations thereof.  A Sony, Lexar, Sandisc, a
PNY, a BUSLINK, a Seagate, Hitachi, a Fujitsu, a Western Digital, or another similar external memory storage device can be used herein.
<BR><BR>It is contemplated that in an embodiment, the transportable data storage device can be adapted to be wireless, and can transmit and receive information using e-mail and packet inter-network grouping systems, which can include IEEE standards
802.11 and 802.15 and BlueTooth.TM..
<BR><BR>The transportable data storage device is engagable with a controller, which can be a scanner, such as a PPI asset controller, model 0001 made by PPI Technology Services of Houston, Tex.
<BR><BR>When the transportable data store device is engaged with the controller, a smart controller is formed that can perform a variety of actions.  Specifically the smart controller can scan or read specific radio frequency identification tags relating
to the information on the transportable data storage device.  The controller is contemplated to have a second processor for connecting to the data storage device.  The controller can also retrieve information from the RFID tags, convert information from
the RFID tags, monitor new RFID tags added to a shipment, provide reports on information from the RFID tags, determine the current location of the smart controller using a global positioning system device, provide notices and alarms by email, cellular or
BlueTooth networks, or other information transfer systems, including the Internet, and sense shock or vibrations during transport using an accelerometer, such as those made by Fisher Scientific having an office in Houston, Tex.
<BR><BR>The one or more pieces of information that describe or are associated with the well equipment can include serial numbers for specific pieces of pipe or equipment, or product descriptions such as the size, weight or color of the products.  The
information can be encoded onto one or more radio frequency identification tags, such as an iQ8 Active Tag made by Identec Solutions of Toronto, Canada, using the first processor, the second processor of the controller, or combinations thereof, forming
an encoded radio frequency identification tag.
<BR><BR>In is contemplated that the radio frequency identification tags can be tamper resistant, for added security and durability.  A tamper resistant RFID tag would be one, such as those made by AeroScout of San Mateo, Calif.
<BR><BR>In another embodiment, the controller can be used to prevent tampering with the RFID tags using an internal or external alarm or emergency notification system, wherein the controller can call or contact a user or administrator, send a text
message, or send email using a cellular network when the well equipment is moved or when the well equipment deviates from the trip plan.  Similarly, a switch can be installed on the RFID tags that provide an alarm to the controller when the well
equipment is moved or if the RFID tag is removed from the equipment.
<BR><BR>In yet another embodiment, it is contemplated that the radio frequency identification tags can be serialized, and the serial numbers can be recorded in the transportable data storage associated with the controller, to provide two simultaneous
confirmations of the encoded RFID tags at a storage or delivery site after transport.  This simultaneous confirmation is an unexpected benefit, that allows for rapid verification of a load, and that is faster than verifications performed in a sequential
manner.
<BR><BR>When the encoded radio frequency tag is removably attached to a piece of well equipment, a piece of traceable well equipment is created that can be detected en route by the smart controller.
<BR><BR>The traceable well equipment and the smart controller can then be transported to a site in a shipping device, such as an equipment basket or a shipping container that meets a standardized shipping ASTM size of 8 feet by 40 feet, an ISO standard,
and other containers for a truck, a ship, an aircraft, a train, or other similar transportation means.  A shipping device can meet an API 8C standard, as indicated by the 2007 American Petroleum Institute standards.  The shipping device should meet a
defined shipping size and standard, such as the standards stated in the British standard, BS EN 12079, or the international standard DNV 2.7-1.
<BR><BR>The shipping device can include a shipping module, a box, a crate, a basket, or a standardized intermodal shipping container.  Any number of identical or different kinds of shipping devices can be used to transport any quantity or type of well
equipment.
<BR><BR>The controller can include a mounting bracket sensor located on a mounting bracket, that can be used to secure the smart controller to one or more of the pieces of well equipment for added stability and security.
<BR><BR>The mounting sensor can include a contact switch or proximity sensor.  The mounting bracket can be the same size as the controller housing, or slightly larger or smaller, such as +/-30% in size.
<BR><BR>Destination sites can include well locations having one or more hydrocarbon wells, water wells, injection wells, such as disposal wells, enhanced recovery injection wells, or combinations thereof.
<BR><BR>Destination sites can include work sites, such as sites with assembled parts for unfinished wells, or manufacturing locations or assembly locations, such as locations where well parts are manufactured or assembled.
<BR><BR>It is also contemplated that a destination site can include a storage area for long term storage, a holding area for short term storage, or a transport vehicle, such as a ship, boat, barge, train, car, truck, or aircraft.
<BR><BR>During transport to the site, the smart controller periodically or continuously scans or reads the traceable well equipment, which can be in a shipping device.
<BR><BR>If not scanned continuously, the smart controller can scan the traceable well equipment at one or more predefined intervals, such as every 30 minutes, every hour, or every 6 hours, or every 12 hours, or at intervals ranging from 0.1 second to 60
seconds, throughout transport, to detect and store the information from the encoded radio frequency identification tags in the transportable data storage device, forming stored scanned radio frequency identification tag information.
<BR><BR>The information obtained from the radio frequency identification tags can be written into the transportable data storage.
<BR><BR>The information in the transportable data storage can then be written to a third processor, which can be located at the site where the well equipment is to be delivered or at an intermediate site, for prevention of fraud during transport and to
insure validation that the load has not been tampered with.
<BR><BR>The information can be accessed by the third processor to verify the successful transport of traceable well equipment without deviation, loss, or tampering.  In an embodiment, the third processor can have in memory, or the transportable data
storage device can contain, additional computer instructions for instructing the third processor to generate a report relating to the stored scanned radio frequency identification tag information for use by another party, such as a foreman, the user, or
an administrator at the site or at a remote location.  This report can be transferred by satellite or another kind of network for use by a plurality of users connected on a network.
<BR><BR>The third processor can be located at the destination site or at an intermediate site.  It is contemplated that the third processor can be in any location and be in wireless communication with the smart controller, such as via a cellular network,
wherein the third processor calls the smart controller over a cellular network, as one would phone another cellular device.
<BR><BR>In an embodiment, a fourth processor can be remote from the site while the third processor is located on site.  The third processor and the fourth processor can be connected by a network so that the smart controller can communicate between the
third processor and the fourth processor instantaneously.  It is contemplated that any number of processors, located on site or remote from the site, can be in communication with the smart scanner or with each other processor via a network.  For
extremely fast conveyance of information, it is contemplated that the smart controller can communicate to the third and fourth processors through two different gateway protocols simultaneously.
<BR><BR>Following the transport of the well equipment, the present method can include removing the encoded radio frequency identification tags for reuse, which is an environmentally correct practice that is not currently done in the oil and natural gas
industry.
<BR><BR>It is also contemplated that the controller's second processor can have memory with sufficient capacity to contain a copy of the information being loaded and contained on the transportable data storage.
<BR><BR>It is contemplated that the this method can be used in conjunction with a toll service or border inspection service, so that trucks can move, in the manner of an "EZ PASS" across state lines, enabling truckers to continue driving without stopping
at a border station.  In this embodiment, the third processor can be a government processor that reads the RFID tags, or the smart controller can specifically transmit the information relating to the well equipment to the third processor at the border
station or at the government agency site, enabling fast transport of the well equipment without additional paperwork needing to be filled out or stopping of the transport.  This is a noteworthy advantage of the present method.
<BR><BR>In a contemplated embodiment, the information relating to the well equipment can be a limited amount of information for a fast communication between the smart controller and the third processor, a fourth processor located remote from the well
equipment, such as at a centralized location that can be a site or office of an administrator of the transport process, which can be miles from the well site.  Any combination of remote or on-site processors can be in communication and receive the
limited information from the smart controller.
<BR><BR>The fourth processor can be remote from the controller or the transportation route, such as at a home office of a manager in communication with the smart controller through a wireless, cellular, or a satellite link.
<BR><BR>The limited information can include from three to five components of information, which can include a part number, size of equipment, job number, serial number, brand name, color, material, chemical composition, other similar information, and
combinations thereof.
<BR><BR>The limited information could include, in another embodiment, from one to 100 or more distinct pieces of information.  The "limited information" is only limited by the amount of data each radio frequency identification tag can hold, and the
number of RFID tags used in performing the present method.  Any number of RFID tags could be used to label a piece of well equipment.  As processing and data storage capacity increases, the quantity of data or pieces of information that is quickly
transferable will also increase.  It is contemplated that the information installed on the RFID tags is limited only so that it can be transferred very quickly, in fewer than ten minutes, more preferably in fewer than three minutes, and even more
preferably in fewer than two minutes.
<BR><BR>It is also contemplated that the limited information can include a trip plan relating to the well equipment.  A trip plan is a predetermined route, including stopping places, fueling stops, hotels for the driver, maintenance stops, additional
pick up locations, airport load and offload zones, train load and offload areas, ports, ship deck locations, origin and destination locations, allocated time per segment and allocated overall time of the trip, and combinations thereof.
<BR><BR>In an embodiment, the smart controller can include a global positioning system transceiver, such as a Garmin.TM.  GPS or a Tom Tom.TM.  GPS. The data storage in the smart controller can include computer instructions for instructing the second
processor of the smart controller to use the global positioning system transceiver to synchronize coordinates received by the global positioning system transceiver to the trip plan.  The second processor of the smart controller can then provide at least
one time stamp including a time and set of coordinates for the well equipment during transport.
<BR><BR>It is further contemplated that the data storage in communication with the third processor can contain computer instructions for instructing the third processor to provide a notification to a user that the RFID tagged well equipment has deviated
from the trip plan.
<BR><BR>Referring now to FIG. 1, a flowchart depicting the steps of an embodiment of the present method is shown.
<BR><BR>The depicted embodiment the present method begins by writing information into a transportable data storage (100).  This step can include transferring computer data relating to one or more pieces of well equipment to the transportable data storage
using a computer, a wireless connection, or other similar means.
<BR><BR>The depicted embodiment then includes keying a specific identification number into radio frequency identification tags as they are manufactured, and then attaching the correct RFID tags to specific pieces of well equipment (101).
<BR><BR>For this embodiment, the next step involves encoding information into one or more radio frequency identification tags (102).  The encoding can be performed using any standard encoding or <B><I>encryption</I></B> method, such as 128 bit American <B><I>Encryption</I></B>
Standard.  This encoding step forms traceable well equipment.
<BR><BR>The depicted embodiment of FIG. 1, then includes engaging the transportable data storage with a controller (Step 103) forming the smart controller.
<BR><BR>This step (103) can be performed by physically or wirelessly connecting the transportable data storage medium to the controller, such as by inserting the data storage medium into a complementary port on the controller, or by using a wireless
connection.  This step forms a smart controller.  The smart controller can scan radio frequency identification tags for information that matches the information contained on the transportable data storage medium.
<BR><BR>It is contemplated that in yet another embodiment, not shown, the transportable data storage can be engaged with the controller (103), forming a smart controller, after writing information into the transportable data storage (101).  Then, the
step of encoding the RFID tags (102) and attaching the correct RFID tags to a specific piece of well equipment (101) can be performed.
<BR><BR>The depicted embodiment of FIG. 1, then includes transporting the well equipment and controller to a destination while scanning or reading information from the radio frequency identification tags at intervals and storing the information in the
transportable data storage medium (106).  The intervals at which the radio frequency identification tags are scanned can be continuous, extremely infrequent, or have any varying degree of frequency as necessary to monitor the transport of the traceable
well equipment.
<BR><BR>The depicted embodiment includes the optional step of sending the information and/or a time stamp to a user (107).  This can include time and global positioning system coordinate information, or any information relating to the transit of the
traceable well equipment.
<BR><BR>The depicted embodiment also includes writing the scanned stored information to data storage (108), such as a data storage in communication with a separate processor.  The stored information can then be accessed and viewed by a user, such as by
using a computer, a cellular telephone, a personal digital assistant, or at least one other similar device.
<BR><BR>The depicted embodiment further includes the optional step of generating a report on the scanned stored information (109).  The report can be generated using a printer in communication with a processor, or the report can be generated on a screen
of a device having a display, such as a computer, a cellular telephone, or a personal digital assistant.
<BR><BR>The depicted embodiment concludes with the optional step of removing the radio frequency identification tags for future use (110).  The ability to reuse the RFID tags saves a tremendous amount of expense otherwise associated with "one way" RFID
tags and avoids the negative environmental impacts created by the disposal of RFID tags that are not reuseable.
<BR><BR>Referring now to FIG. 2, a diagram of the parts of a system useable with an embodiment of the present method.
<BR><BR>FIG. 2 depicts well equipment (5) having a radio frequency identification tag (18) attached thereon.  While well equipment (5) is depicted as a single tubular, well equipment (5) can be any type or quantity of well equipment or structures that

with the second processor (21).  A wireless chip set (39) can also be installed in the smart controller (19) for communication with the second processor (21).
<BR><BR>The smart controller (19) can include a single unit that can perform both cellular and satellite communications.
<BR><BR>FIG. 3 also depicts power source (17) for supplying power to smart controller (19).
<BR><BR>FIG. 4 depicts a piece of well equipment as traceable well equipment (10), because the RFID tag (18) with information relating to the well equipment has been attached to the well equipment, allowing the well equipment to be traceable.  In this
embodiment, FIG. 4 depicts a mounting bracket sensor (151) for a mounting bracket (152) for securing the smart controller to the traceable well equipment.
<BR><BR>The mounting sensor can include a contact switch or proximity sensor.  The mounting bracket can be the same size as the housing for the smart controller (19), or slightly larger or smaller, such as +/-30% in size.
<BR><BR>The well equipment can be placed into a shipping device (28), which can be any kind of shipping means including containers for transport on ships, aircraft, cars, trains, and other similar means.  Shipping device (28) is depicted as a shipping

(91) for receiving the transportable data storage and enabling downloading of the information to the data storage (41) of the third processor.  The third processor (40) can further have a wireless chip set (93) for wireless communication with the second
processor (21).  Use of a wireless chip set (93) can also enable the present method to utilize a third processor (40) that is remote from the well site.
<BR><BR>The third processor can have a display (43a).  Display (43a) can be viewed by a user (44a) to monitor the status of traceable well equipment (10) instantaneously and in real time at the site.
<BR><BR>A fourth processor (42) is also depicted in communication with the second processor (21) via a protocol gateway (89) to a network (100).  The fourth processor (42) can be remote from the well site, such as an administrator's computer 100 miles
from the site.
<BR><BR>The fourth processor can have a display (43b).  Display (43b) can be viewed by a second user (44b) to monitor the status of traceable well equipment (10) instantaneously and in real time, remote to the site.  Additionally, the user and second
user can monitor the information simultaneously.
<BR><BR>Display (43a) or display (43b) can be a computer monitor, a screen on a cellular telephone or personal digital assistant, or any other type of display or graphical user interface.
<BR><BR>While these embodiments have been described with emphasis on the embodiments, it should be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the embodiments might be practiced other than as specifically described herein.
