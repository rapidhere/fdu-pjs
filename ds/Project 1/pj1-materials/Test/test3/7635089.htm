</font><BR>
<BR><CENTER><B>Abstract</B></CENTER>
<P>A device is provided for shielding a contactless smartcard or <B><I>RFID</I></B> tag
     from reading. The device can include a first panel for holding and
     presenting a contactless smartcard, a second panel comprising a shielding
     material that prevents unauthorized reading of information when the
     contactless smartcard is in proximity to or resting on the second panel,
     and a hinge coupling the first panel and the second panel. The hinge
     keeps the device closed for preventing unauthorized reading, and open
     when a force is applied for allowing authorized reading. The contactless
     smartcard can be inserted between the first panel and the second panel.

<BR><BR>The present invention relates to radio frequency identification and, more particularly, to devices and methods for protecting information in radio frequency identification systems.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND
<BR><BR>Contactless smartcard systems and RFID smartcard systems are employed in a wide range of applications.  Contactless smartcards may be credit card sized cards having an embedded microchip that stores data including financial data, health data, and
other data, although the smartcards can come in many different sizes and shapes.  RFID smartcards may be credit card sized cards having an RFID chip that stores data including financial data, health data, and other data, although the smartcards can come
in many different sizes and shapes.  Contactless smartcards communicate information wirelessly with a smartcard reader using magnetic, radio frequency (RF), infrared, microwave, light, and/or ultraviolet radiation.  For contactless smartcards that use
magnetic radiation, RF radiation, or microwave radiation, the smartcards may be read from an owners pocket, wallet, purse or other carrier that is located remote from the smartcard reader.  RFID smartcards communicate information wirelessly with a reader
using magnetic or radio frequency (RF) radiation that may be read from a owner's pocket, wallet, purse or other carrier that is located remote from the reader As a result, data from contactless smartcards and/or RFID smartcards may be accessed and read
without an owners awareness.
<BR><BR>Commercially available smartcard readers and/or RFID smartcard readers are designed to read from various different ranges, from distances of an inch or two up to distances of several hundred feet, depending on the strength and frequency of the
signals.  Readers may be designed with greater magnetic and RF field strength in order to increase an effective range for reading contactless smartcards and/or RFID smartcards.  While software <B><I>encryption</I></B> technology is available to protect data that is
stored on contactless smartcards and/or RFID smartcards, it is possible to compromise the various software <B><I>encryption</I></B> techniques.  In addition, some smartcards do not include <B><I>encryption</I></B>.  Other drawbacks exist.

<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>While the specification concludes with claims defining the features of the embodiments of the invention that are regarded as novel, it is believed that the method, system, and other embodiments will be better understood from a consideration of
the following description in conjunction with the drawing figures, in which like reference numerals are carried forward.
<BR><BR>As required, detailed embodiments of the present method and system are disclosed herein.  However, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary, which can be embodied in various forms.  Therefore, specific structural
and functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the embodiments of the present invention in
virtually any appropriately detailed structure.  Further, the terms and phrases used herein are not intended to be limiting but rather to provide an understandable description of the embodiment herein.  The terms "a" or "an," as used herein, are defined
as one or more than one.  The term "plurality," as used herein, is defined as two or more than two.  The term "another," as used herein, is defined as at least a second or more.  The terms "including" and/or "having," as used herein, are defined as
comprising (i.e., open language).
<BR><BR>While specific embodiments of the invention are discussed herein and are illustrated in the drawings appended hereto, the invention encompasses a broader spectrum than the specific subject matter described and illustrated.  As would be
appreciated by those skilled in the art, the embodiments described herein provide but a few examples of the broad scope of the invention.  There is no intention to limit the scope of the invention only to the embodiments described.
<BR><BR>The invention provides electromagnetic shielding for radio frequency RFID smartcards and/or contactless smartcards.  Such shielding can be used to prevent wireless communications with the smartcards, such as in order to prevent unauthorized
wireless access to data stored on the smartcards.  The present disclosure describes shielding of RFID smartcards.  It should be understood that the present disclosure contemplates shielding of other types of electronic devices that are remotely
accessible via electromagnetic energy such as RFID tags, as well as shielding of other types of electronic devices.  Accordingly, as used herein "contactless smartcards" and "smartcards" include electronic devices that are remotely accessible via
electromagnetic energy including, but not limited to, minicards, fobs, credit cards, security identification cards, such as RFID passports, ATM cards, and payment cards, such as those used for public transit, public phones, and electronic toll
collection, among others.
<BR><BR>Referring to FIG. 1A, a device 100 for shielding a contactless smartcard 200 or RFID smartcard is shown.  According to one embodiment, the device 100 may receive a RFID smartcard, contactless smartcard 200, and/or other card-shaped devices having
electromagnetic data exchanging capabilities.  In practice, the contactless smartcard 200 can be inserted into the device 100, to allow for secure holding of the card.  The contactless smartcard 200 may be the size of a credit card that measures
approximately 85.6 mm.times.53.98.times.0.76 mm, or the contactless smartcard 200 may be the size of a larger identification card that measures approximately 3.4 in..times.4.9 in..times.0.1 in. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that smartcards
having other sizes and configurations are intended to be encompassed by the invention.  Regardless of the size and configuration of the smartcard, the shielding device can be dimensioned to securely receive the smartcard.
<BR><BR>In one arrangement, the device 100 may serve as a badge for holding an identification card 200.  For example, referring to FIG. 1B, the device 100 can include a clip 190 that attaches to the owner for allowing the owner to wear the badge.  The
clip 190 can include an extension which allows the owner to present the badge without removing the badge.  The badge can be retracted via the clip 190 following presentation of the badge.
<BR><BR>Briefly, the device 100 can be configured to prevent access to information stored in RFID smartcards, contactless smartcards, RFID passports and/or other wireless devices that are placed in the device 100 at any distance from a reader, including
direct contact with a reader.  This can be done for various selected frequencies, ranges of frequencies and/or all frequencies.  Depending on the materials used to form the device 100, the device may be configured to be a barrier to, or otherwise
prevent, one or more selected frequencies, such as 125 kHz, 13.56 MHz, 915 MHz, and/or other frequencies of electromagnetic radiation from accessing RFID smartcards, contactless smartcards, RFID passports and/or other wireless devices that are placed
within selected ranges from a reader to direct contact with a reader, blocking or otherwise being a barrier to the near and/or far fields of the selected frequency(ies).
<BR><BR>The term "blocking" and/or "barrier" is not intended to be limiting and includes all interaction between the device 100 and the electromagnetic radiation that prevents reading of the smartcard 200.  Thus, blocking or being a barrier can include a
sufficient reduction of the electromagnetic radiation that reaches the antenna of the smartcard 200 to prevent a readable transmission of data from the smartcard.  For example, "blocking" includes both attenuation and reflection so long as there is a
sufficient reduction of the electromagnetic radiation that reaches the antenna of the smartcard 200 to prevent a readable transmission of data from the smartcard.
<BR><BR>The distance ranges for which device 100 can the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation that is selected, because as the frequency gets higher, the near field becomes larger.  The shielding technique used can vary and can include deflection,
attenuation, absorption, reflection, and any combination thereof.  For example, a faraday's cage can be established to sufficiently surround the contactless smartcard 200 and prevent reading thereof.
<BR><BR>A ground plane can also be used so that when the contactless smartcard 200 is in proximity to the ground plane, reading is prevented.  In such a ground plane, the E-field tends to hit the conductive ground plane at right angles, rendering it
difficult or impossible for the field to induce an electric potential along any conductive paths parallel to the ground plane.  Similarly, because an H-field located near a metallic surface tends to have its predominant field component parallel to the
surface, it will be unable to induce currents into any cable loop or other conductive path placed close to the ground plane.  Keeping the conductive paths as close as possible to a reference ground plane can be an effective way of EM shielding.  As will
be described later, the smartcard 200 can then be moved a sufficient distance from the ground plane to allow for reading of the smartcard.
<BR><BR>Referring back to FIG. 1A, the device 100 can include a first panel or holding member 110 (e.g., a plastic panel) for holding and presenting the contactless smartcard 200, a second panel or shielding member 210 (e.g., a plastic panel) comprising
a shielding material that prevents unauthorized reading of information from the contactless smartcard when the contactless smartcard is in proximity to or resting on the second plastic panel, and at least one hinge or other movable connection 130
coupling the first plastic panel 110 and the second plastic panel 210.  It should be understood that while the exemplary embodiment described herein has first and second panels 110, 210 that are made from plastic, the present disclosure contemplates the
panels being made from materials other than plastic, as well as combinations of materials, such as, for example, being partially made from a plastic and one or more other materials.  The hinge 130 can include a spring or other biasing element (not shown)
operatively coupled to the first plastic panel 110 and the second plastic panel 210 for keeping the first plastic panel 110 and the second plastic panel 210 together in a default configuration.  Accordingly, the hinge keeps the first plastic panel 110
and second plastic panel 210 together in a closed configuration or in close proximity to each other for preventing unauthorized reading.  The hinge can be separated when a force is applied for allowing the first plastic panel 110 and the second plastic
panel 210 to separate for authorized reading of the contactless smartcard.  This particular arrangement allows for operation of the hinge 130 through use of only one hand and preferably through use of only two fingers.
<BR><BR>For example, the first plastic panel 110 can include an angled tab extension 111 for providing leverage to separate the first plastic panel 110 and the second plastic panel 210 upon a squeezing of the angled tab extension 111 with a flat tab
extension 211 of the second plastic panel.  Notably, the angled tab extension 111 is positioned on the first plastic panel 110 holding the contactless smartcard 200.  This is an ergonomic feature that facilitates keeping the first plastic panel 110 in
place upon depressing the first tab 111 and second tab 211.  In practice, when a user squeezes the first tab 111 and the second tab 211, the second plastic panel 210 retracts away from the first plastic panel 110, thereby leaving the first panel in
place.  For instance, when a user presents the device 100 to a reader (not shown) and squeezes the tabs together, the back portion (e.g. second plastic panel 110) moves away from the front portion (e.g. first plastic panel 110), and the front portion 110
remains in place in front of the reader.  A reader is an electronic device or system that can read information stored on the contactless smartcard 200.  Of course the movement of the first and second panels 110, 210 is relative to each other and the
present disclosure contemplates movement of either or both to achieve the separation.  The first and second tabs 111, 211 can have various grips and other structures thereon to facilitate squeezing and provide other functions such as comfort.
<BR><BR>The first plastic panel 110, the second plastic panel 210, and the hinge 130 can all be made of the same material, but are not limited to such.  For example the material may include polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a polycarbonate blend, a
polymer blend, a plastic, or moldable plastics.  The components may be made from plastic mold injection or over molds.
<BR><BR>Referring to FIG. 2, a detailed cross section of the device 100 showing multiple layers is shown.  As illustrated, the first plastic panel 110 may include an opening 150 for allowing slidable positioning of the contactless smartcard 200.  The
first plastic panel 110 may include visually translucent portions, visually transparent portions, or both for viewing a surface of an RFID smartcard and/or contactless smartcard 200 provided therein.  The particular size and shape of the opening 150 can
be chosen based upon the smartcard that is to be positioned and viewed within the device.  Additionally, the opening 150 allows direct and unobstructed viewing and visual reading of the smartcard 200 while the smartcard 200 is disposed within the device
100.  Opening 150 allows a user to slide the smartcard 200 out of the device 100 with a single finger such as a thumb which facilitates the use of the device.
<BR><BR>The first angled tab 111 is also shown as an extension of the first plastic panel 110.  The hinge 130 (see FIG. 1) can comprise a hook 112 that is an appendage of the first plastic panel 110, and a pin 112 that is an appendage of the second
plastic panel 210.  When connected, the hook 111 clips on to the pin 112 such that the first plastic panel 110 pivots on the pin of the second plastic panel.  The second plastic panel 210 can also include the flat tab as an extension for providing
leverage over the hinge with the angled tab 111 of the first plastic panel.  Although not shown, it should be apparent that the hinge 130 can comprise a hook 112 that is an appendage of the second plastic panel 210, and a pin 112 that is an appendage of
the first plastic panel 110.  In general, the hook and the pin the form a hinge will be appendages of opposing panels.  Of course, the present disclosure contemplates other mechanisms and methods of moveably connecting the first and second panels 110,
210.
<BR><BR>The shielding material 170 can be an aluminum, stainless steel, radio frequency blocking paper, or other electromagnetically opaque material.  The shielding material may be incorporated into the shielding device in the form of a film, a particle,
a fiber, a nonwoven, or any other appropriate form.  According to one embodiment, shielding material 170 shields RFID smartcards, contactless smartcards, RFID passports and/or other wireless devices from magnetic and/or electric fields.  According to
another embodiment of the invention, shielding material 170 protects wireless cards from electromagnetic radiation including magnetic, radio frequency, infrared, microwave, light, ultraviolet and/or other electromagnetic radiation.  According to another
embodiment of the invention, shielding material 170 may be constructed from metalized polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic or another moldable plastic.  Another useful shielding material 170 includes EMI shielding material manufactured by Chomerics
(a division of Parker Hannifin Corp.), such as the "Premier" and "Win-Shield" shielding materials.  The shielding material 170 can be embedded in a thermoplastic compound, for example, a thermoplastic matrix that includes one or more of a shielding
material such as carbon fiber, stainless steel fiber or nickel-coated carbon fiber.
<BR><BR>The shielding material 170 may be affixed to the second plastic panel 210 using hot, cold and/or physical fastening, such as glue, heat sealing, heat staking, sonic welding, and/or other fastener materials or techniques.  Moreover, the first
plastic panel 110 may include a lipped perimeter 115 that fits in a channeled perimeter 215 of the second plastic panel 210 for sealing together the first plastic panel and second plastic panel.  Accordingly, the shielding material may also include a
lipped perimeter 175 for securely fitting the lipped perimeter 115 and the channeled perimeter 215 and keeping the shielding material 170 in place.  The lip-channel fitting can provide a sealing mechanism, such as a zip lock seal or other sealing
mechanism, for providing water resistance.  The second plastic panel 210 may be adapted so as not to include any sharp edges that may damage items, such as clothing, wallets, purses, or other items.
<BR><BR>Referring to FIG. 3, the shielding material 170 may also be incorporated into an electromagnetically opaque paper product comprising multiple layers laminated together.  According to one embodiment of the invention, the multiple layers may be
arranged to include a Tyvek.RTM.  layer 171, a Polyethylene layer 172, an electromagnetically opaque layer 173, and a second Polyethylene layer 174, among other layers.  According to one embodiment, the electromagnetically opaque layer 173 may include
aluminum, MuMetal.RTM., Toppan.RTM.  RF blocking paper, foil, and/or another electromagnetically opaque material.  According to another embodiment of the invention, the electromagnetically opaque layer 173 of the shielding material 170 may include any
magnetic or electric type shielding material that is laminated to Tyvek.RTM.  paper.
<BR><BR>According to yet another embodiment of the invention, the electromagnetically opaque paper product including the shielding material 170 may or may not include polyethylene.  According to another embodiment of the invention, the
electromagnetically opaque paper product including the shielding material 170 may be configured to reduce scratching of surfaces of RFID smartcards and/or contactless smartcards placed therein.  According to yet another embodiment of the invention, the
electromagnetically opaque paper product including the shielding material 170 can be water-resistant and may or may not be waterproof.  According to one embodiment of the invention, the electromagnetically opaque paper product of the shielding material
170 may include electromagnetically opaque materials on one side of Tyvek.RTM.  layer 171 or on both sides of Tyvek.RTM.  layer 171.  According to another embodiment of the invention, Tyvek.RTM.  layer 171 may be rigid or flexible.  According to an
alternative embodiment of the invention, the multiple layers may be arranged to include polyethylene layer 172, electromagnetically opaque layer 173, and a second polyethylene layer 174, among other layers, without Tyvek.RTM.  layer 171.  Although
Tyvek.RTM.  is an exemplary paper product layer, other materials are also envisioned, including, but not limited to, paper, spunbond, meltblown, bonded carded webs, metal sheets, films, hydroentangled materials, woven materials, and layered combinations
thereof, for example laminates such as spunbond-meltblown-spunbond and spunbond-film.
<BR><BR>Referring to FIGS. 4 and 5, a first slice 310 is referenced to show an a1-a2 cross section of an interior portion, and a second slice 320 is referenced to show a b1-b2 cross section of an exterior portion.  The device 100 may include a first
hinge 321 and a second hinge 322 on the exterior portion.  Referring to FIG. 6, the a1-a2 cross section 310 is shown.  Referring to FIG. 7, the b1-b2 cross section 320 is shown.  In particular, the hinge 130 for the exterior portion is shown, which may
or may not extend into the interior portion as shown in FIG. 6.  That is, the hinge 130 may be absent in the interior portion.
<BR><BR>Referring to FIG. 8, an enlarged image of the a1-a2 cross section 310 is shown.  In particular, the layers for the first plastic panel 110, the contactless smartcard 200, the shielding material 170, and the second plastic panel 210 are shown. 
Notably, when in a closed configuration, the contactless smartcard 200 rests against or is in proximity to the shielding material 170 to prevent unauthorized reading.  The angled tab 111 and the flat tab 211 are also shown for illustration.
<BR><BR>Referring to FIG. 9, an enlarged image of the b1-b2 cross section 320 is shown.  In particular, the layers for the first plastic panel 110, the contactless smartcard 200, the shielding material 170, and the second plastic panel 210 are shown. 
Notably, when in a closed configuration, the shielding material 170 is in close proximity to the contactless smartcard 200 to prevent unauthorized reading.  The present disclosure further contemplates the shielding material 170 surrounding the
contactless smartcard 200, either partially or completely, to prevent unauthorized reading.  For example, briefly referring back to FIG. 2, the channeled perimeter 175 of the shielding material 170 is sufficiently corrugated for secure placement and to
prevent unauthorized reading of the contactless smartcard 200 from the sides.  The first hook 112 of the first plastic panel 110 and the first pin of the second plastic panel 212 are also shown for illustration.  Notably, the hook 112 and the pin may or
may not extend across the entire device 100 as shown in FIG. 8.
<BR><BR>Referring to FIG. 10, the a1-a2 cross section 310 of the device in a closed configuration (311) is shown.  Notably, the first plastic panel 110 is together with the second plastic panel 210 in a default configuration.  Recall, the device 100 may
include a spring hinge which keeps sufficient pressure to keep the first plastic panel 110 and second plastic panel 210 in a closed configuration.  In the closed configuration, the contactless smartcard 200 can rest against or be in close proximity to
the shielding material 170.  The shielding material 170 can be an electromagnetically opaque paper affixed to the second plastic panel 210 as previously recited.  Accordingly, when the first plastic panel 110 holding the contactless smart card 200 rests
against or is in close proximity to the shielding material 170 of the second plastic panel 210, information is blocked from being read.  That is, the close proximity or coupling of the contactless smartcard 200 and the shielding material 170 in a closed
configuration prevents unauthorized reading of the contactless smartcard 200.
<BR><BR>In an alternate configuration, the shielding material 170 may be embedded in the material, e.g. plastic, used to form the second plastic panel 210.  In either case, the second plastic panel 210 may serve as a ground plane and prevent contactless
smartcard reading devices from accessing the information stored on the smart card with the smart card is in close proximity and parallel to the second plastic panel 210.
<BR><BR>However, in an open configuration, the contactless smartcard 200 is sufficiently distant from the shielded material 170 to allow authorized reading.  When the user depresses the angled tab 111 and the flat tab 211, the device 100 enters the open
configuration by moving the contactless smartcard 200 to a position a sufficient distance from the shielding material 170 to allow reading of the smartcard.  In addition, the device pivots such that the smartcard is no longer parallel to the second panel
210.  The present disclosure contemplates the movement of the contactless smartcard 200 with respect to the shielding material 170 to be relative, so that the smartcard, shielding material or both may be set in motion.  Separation of the contactless
smartcard 200 with respect to the shielding material 170 can also include moving the smartcard from a first position of being surrounded, either partially or completely, by the shielding material to a second position of not being surrounded by the
shielding material.
<BR><BR>Referring to FIG. 11, the a1-a2 cross section 310 of the device 100 in an open configuration (312) for exemplary use is shown.  Notably, the first plastic panel 110 is separated from the second plastic panel 210 when the user depresses the angled
tab 111 and the flat tab 211 (See FIG. 11).  In particular, when the user depresses the angled tab 111 and flat tab 211 for presenting the contactless smartcard 200, the second plastic panel 210 having the shielding material 170 is retracted away from
the first plastic panel 110 holding the contactless smartcard 200.  In this manner, in an open configuration, the shielding material 170 is no longer resting behind or in close proximity to the contactless smart card 200, and the information can be read
by a smartcard reader emitting electromagnetic radiation from in the front of the contactless smartcard 200.  Moreover, the shielding material 170 on the second plastic panel 210 can also blocks radiation, thereby preventing reading from a direction
behind the smartcard 200.  That is, the coupling of the first plastic panel 110 and the second plastic panel 210 even in an open configuration, can still substantially prevent reading by a smartcard reader emitting electromagnetic radiation from behind
the smartcard 200.  However, the present disclosure also contemplates movement of the smartcard 200 with respect to the shielding material 170 a sufficient distance so that reading of the smartcard can be done from both a front and rear direction, as
well as other directions if desired.
<BR><BR>Referring to FIG. 12, an enlarged image of the b1-b2 cross section 320 for an open configuration is shown.  In particular, the layers for the first plastic panel 110, the contactless smartcard 200, the shielding material 170, and the second
plastic panel 210 are shown.  The channeled perimeter 175 (See FIG. 2A) is also shown.  Notably, when in an open configuration, the contactless smartcard 200 is retracted away from the shielding material 170 to allow authorized reading.  The hinge 130 is
also shown which is part of the exterior portion as shown in FIG. 5 and corresponding to the second hinge 322.
<BR><BR>Referring to FIG. 13, an enlarged image of the b1-b2 cross section 320 for a closed configuration is shown.  In particular, the layers for the first plastic panel 110, the contactless smartcard 200, the shielding material 170, and the second
plastic panel 210 are shown.  Notably, when in a closed configuration, the shielding material 170 is in close proximity to the contactless smartcard 200 to prevent unauthorized reading.  For example, briefly referring back to FIG. 2, the channeled
perimeter 175 of the shielding material 170 can be sufficiently corrugated to prevent unauthorized reading of the card from the sides.
<BR><BR>Referring to FIG. 14 a perspective view of the device 100 of FIG. 1 is shown.  In particular, the first plastic panel 110 is shown receiving the contactless smartcard 200.  Specifically, the contactless smartcard 200 can be slid into the first
plastic panel 110.  The first plastic panel 110 includes a flanged portion 114 for receiving and securely holding the contactless smartcard 200.  The contactless smartcard 200 can slide into the flanged portion 114 underneath the angled tab 111 of the
first plastic panel 110.  Notably, the contactless smartcard 200 can be slid into the first plastic panel 110 which does not contain the shielded material 170.  Notably, the shielded material 170 is embedded in or affixed to the second plastic panel 210
which is retracted away from the first plastic panel 110 in an open configuration as shown in FIG. 11.
<BR><BR>Referring to FIG. 15, an image sequence for inserting a contactless smart card 200 is shown.  In particular, the image sequence illustrates how the smartcard is inserted in the first plastic panel (e.g. top plastic panel).  For example, at
sequence 510, prior to insertion, the flanged portion 114 of the first plastic panel has an empty slot.  At sequence 520, the contactless smartcard 200 can be slid into the flanged portion 114 underneath the angled tab 111.  Referring to FIG. 16, an
enlarged image of sequence 520 is shown.  Notably, the contactless smartcard 200 is inserted through an opening 117 underneath the angled tab 111.  Returning back to FIG. 15, at sequence 530, the flanged portion 114 has completely received the
contactless smartcard 200.  Notably, the contactless smartcard 200 is inserted through the top opening of the device 100.  Accordingly, when the device 100 is used as a badge (See FIG. 2), the contactless smartcard 200 cannot slip out of the device 100,
as the primary means for removing the contactless smartcard 200 is through the top opening.
<BR><BR>Referring to FIG. 17, a side view perspective of the device 100 showing three views is shown.  In particular, the side view perspectives illustrate how the contactless smart card 200 can be inserted within the device 100.  Notably, the
contactless smartcard 200 can be inserted between the angled tab 111 of the first plastic panel 110 and the flat tab 112 of the second plastic panel 210.  Various viewing angles are presented for clearly illustrating the insertion of the contactless
smartcard 200 in the opening between the first plastic panel 110 and the second plastic panel 210.  The side view perspective also shows the border 211 of the second plastic panel 210 which can be made of the same material as the second plastic panel
210.
<BR><BR>Referring to FIG. 18, multiple views of the device 100 suitable for use as a badge are shown.  For example, the badge can hold an identification card and prevent unauthorized access.  The badge can be worn by a user, who can present the
identification card to a reader.  For example, referring back to FIG. 2, the user can depress the tabs of the badge to retract the shielding portion for allowing authorized reading of the identification card.  Notably, other embodiments of the device 100
are herein contemplated and are not restricted to using the device 100 only as an identification badge.  For example, the device 100 may be a clipboard for holding paper forms containing confidential information, a clear plastic box or envelope for
holding contactless smartcards, a slim carrying case with a flip top for holding contactless smartcards, or a folding passport containing secure information.
<BR><BR>It should be understood that the particular size and shape of the shielding material can be chosen based upon the technique of EM shielding that is being utilized.  The particular material can also be chosen based upon the particular EM shielding
technique being used.  Where ground plane shielding is being utilized the size, shape, material and distance of separation between the contactless smartcard 200 and the shielding material 170 can be chosen to provide an effective shielding of the
smartcard from reading of the information thereon.
<BR><BR>While preferred forms of the invention have been disclosed, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made that will achieve some of the advantages of the invention without departing from the
spirit and scope of the invention.  Therefore, the scope of the invention will be determined solely by claims that will be added.
