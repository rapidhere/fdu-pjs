<font size="+1">System providing medical personnel with immediate critical data for
     emergency treatments
</font><BR>
<BR><CENTER><B>Abstract</B></CENTER>
<P>An <B><I>RFID</I></B> transponder on a person or animal provides the health care or
     security personnel with the critical information when the personnel
     employs a reader terminal capable of reading the <B><I>RFID</I></B> transponder. The
     transponder, after being interrogated by the reader, supplies the
     critical data such as name, blood type, allergies, directives, medicines,
     and emergency contact numbers. The reader immediately displays such
     critical information on its screen. The <B><I>RFID</I></B> tag can substantiate that it
     belongs to its owner. This identification process can involve biometric
     analysis. The reader terminal downloads additional data from a server and
     the additional data is presented on a reader terminal's screen. The
     server queries the wireless carrier for reader terminal's location data,
     correlates the reader location data with hospital location data, and
     sends the critical information to the nearby hospitals. Additionally, the
     server sends alert information to other firms or individuals contained in
     the transponder wearer's data record. The <B><I>RFID</I></B> tag is the healthcare
     record. It relates and integrates into a larger database and network. It
     proves its owner and through wireless technology identifies location and
     other data characteristics of its owner.

<BR><BR>The present invention relates generally to emergency response systems, and more particularly to emergency information retrieval and display.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>During emergency situations, medical, rescue, and security industry workers frequently encounter persons that are unconscious or otherwise unable to communicate.  Yet, such persons often require immediate medical attention.  Often, such
situations arise outside of the controlled environment of a hospital setting and additional time is required to transport the victim to the nearby medical facility.  Upon arrival to the nearby hospital, however, the medical personnel need yet additional
time to obtain the victim's critical information prior to providing the required medical care.  In case of urgent blood transfusions, for example, it is of utmost importance to obtain the victim's blood type prior to commencing the required procedure. 
Thus, the time lost during transport to the hospital, as well as during running the necessary tests to obtain the victim's medical information, is likely to greatly decrease the risk of survival for some victims.  Therefore, having immediate access to
victim's critical information is imperative to patient survival.
<BR><BR>While medical identification cards and bracelets with imprinted medical and emergency contact information may provide the required information to the on-site emergency personnel, the emergency personnel still need to allocate time to verify that
the imprinted information actually belongs to the person in possession of the card or bracelet in order to prevent potentially deadly mistakes during treatment.  This may require the emergency personnel to spend time to locate the victim's wallet in
order to cross-reference the information on the card or bracelet with that on a driver's license or photo id, for example.  If other identification is lost during the emergency, such verification may not be possible, which increases the risk to the
patient.  In addition to needing time to verify the identity of the victim or patient, the emergency personnel need to allocate time to convey whatever information they do find to the nearby medical facilities.  This results in yet further delays prior
to commencing patient treatment and increases the risk to the patient.
<BR><BR>Furthermore, in above situations, the emergency personnel are not always able to promptly notify the third parties associated with the victim.  This further decreases the flow of necessary information and eliminates the chances of promptly
obtaining the critical information about the victim from the third parties prior to treatment.  Disaster recovery strategies require real time acquisition of personal data with verification and location.
<BR><BR>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>The invention provides urgent/emergency service personnel with critical data about a person or animal, within the first few minutes of an encounter for treatment or identification and allows verification that the critical data describes the
person or animal being treated or identified.  Although the following description refers to "persons," the invention is equally applicable to animals or any living thing that may be in a position of needing immediate medical care in a situation in which
critical medical history is required for successful treatment.
<BR><BR>In one embodiment, a person having a wireless transponder, such as a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) transponder, on his person provides the health care or security personnel with the critical information even when unconscious or dead, when
the health service provider or security personnel employs a device or terminal that reads the RFID transponder.  The terminal or reader interacts with a health or security service provider via an RFID signaling tag.  The terminal includes a point and
click user application to avail itself of data presented by an RFID tag as well as data presented from another database to which the tag might refer.  The terminal activates a software application that is contained either in the RFID tag, the terminal,
or in the database.  The software application includes functionality that allows it to query and download certain information or programs that allow immediate and coordinated information transfer to a network.  The network could be a health care system,
emergency response team, military, industrial or biologic system, for example.  In one embodiment, the network includes livestock and domestic animal applications.  The RFID tag is the healthcare record.  It relates and integrates into a larger database
and network.  It proves its owner and through wireless technology identifies location and other data characteristics of its owner.
<BR><BR>The transponder attaches to a person or animal in any of a number of ways, including a wristband, necklace, ankle bracelet, wristwatch, pin, ID card or a subcutaneous capsule, for example.  In one embodiment, the transponder is encased in a
flexible silicone wristband that is impervious to weather and water.  The transponder, after being interrogated by the reader, supplies the health or security service provider with HIPPA protected critical data such as name, blood type, allergies,
directives, medicines, and emergency contact numbers.  In one embodiment, the transponder also includes verification data, such as biometric verification data, for example in a form of a digital photograph of the person or animal whose critical data is
on the transponder.  In other embodiments, the transponder contains additional important biological data.  The amount of data is only limited by the amount of memory available in the RFID tag or transponder.  The reader immediately displays such critical
information for the health care or security personnel on its screen.
<BR><BR>Further, when the reader terminal is part of a wired or wireless communication device attached to a server containing a more complex and integrated database with further information about the person, the critical information about a person is
presented to a health or security service provider in an immediate manner through an integrated network.
<BR><BR>The data network consists of servers, sets of servers, and integrated software applications that allow data to be identified as belonging to the person or animal that presents its tag/RFID transponder.  Therefore, the RFID tag can substantiate
that it belongs to its owner.  This identification process can involve biometric analysis including, but not limited to, picture (photo), retinal/iris scan, fingerprint, and palm vein scanner.  Further identifiers may include DNA/RNA or dental records
that are utilized as non-urgent bio identifiers.  Once an RFID tag is read by the terminal, the terminal downloads additional data from a server and the additional data is presented on a reader terminal's screen.  Once sent to the server network, the
RFID tag signal starts a series of data retrieval and transmission algorithms.  Ultimately, data transmission to a fax number, phone number, internet, text or voice file, hospital, or company, occurs in order to transmit the critical data such as blood
type, allergies, or meds for critical injury to a hospital E.R, doctor, or other personnel.
<BR><BR>In embodiments, the server queries the wireless carrier for reader terminal's location data, correlates the reader location data with hospital location data, and sends the critical information to the nearby hospitals.  Additionally, the server
sends alert information to other firms or individuals contained in the wristband wearer's data record.
<BR><BR>In another embodiment, the person or animal can have a terminal reader write to an RFID transponder.  This transponder can then be coupled to the person or animal.  This allows emergency retrieval of pertinent healthcare identification
information.  A picture, voice record, ID number, can quickly be written on an RFID tag and placed on an animal.  After writing to the tag, the information is time, date, and GPS stamped and sent to a network. <BR><BR>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL

<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>A critical data retrieval and display system provides the urgent/emergency service personnel with critical data about a person or animal, within the first few minutes of an encounter for treatment or identification and allows verification that
the critical data describes the person or animal being treated or identified.  In one embodiment, a person or animal having a wireless transponder, such as a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) transponder, on his person provides the health care or
security personnel with the critical information even when unconscious or dead, as long as the health service provider or security personnel employs a device or terminal that is capable of reading the RFID transponder.  The terminal or reader interacts
with a health or security service provider via an RFID signaling tag.  The terminal includes a point and click user application to avail itself of data presented by an RFID tag as well as data presented from another database to which the tag might refer. In one embodiment, the terminal is a stand-alone terminal, while in other embodiments the terminal is part of another device, such as a cellular phone, for example.  In one embodiment, the terminal includes circuitry for determining its approximate
location--e.g., a global position system or GPS. Location information can be communicated automatically to a remote site for use by emergency personnel to dispatch additional assistance.  Date, time, and GPS data can be stamped on any terminal RFID tag.
<BR><BR>The terminal activates a software application that is contained either in the RFID tag, the terminal, or in a remote database.  The software application includes functionality that allows it to query and download certain information or programs
that allow immediate and coordinated information transfer to a network.  The network could be a health care system, emergency response team, military, industrial or biologic system, for example.  In one embodiment, the network includes livestock and
domestic animal applications.
<BR><BR>The transponder attaches to a person or animal in any of a number of ways, including a wristband, necklace, ankle bracelet, wristwatch, pin, ID card or a subcutaneous capsule, for example.  The transponder, after being interrogated by the reader,
supplies the health or security service provider with protected critical data such as name, blood type, allergies, directives, medicines, and emergency contact numbers.  HIPPA protection can be incorporated in any system via <B><I>encryption</I></B> technology and
keys.  In one embodiment, the transponder also includes verification data, such as biometric verification data, for example in a form of a digital photograph of the person or animal whose critical data is on the transponder.  In other embodiments, the
transponder contains additional important biological data.  The amount of data is only limited by the amount of memory available in the RFID tag or transponder.  The reader immediately displays such critical information for the health care or security
personnel on its screen.
<BR><BR>Further, when the reader terminal is part of a wired, or wireless communication device attached to a server containing a more complex and integrated database with further information about the person, or when the reader is attached, either with a
cable or wirelessly, to a computer containing further data about the person, all such data (if it were health data) would be HIPPA protected, and thus secure.  Such data is also displayed on the reader or made otherwise available, such as through email,
phone, or fax, for example.  In this way, critical information about a person is presented to a health or security service provider in an immediate manner through an integrated network.
<BR><BR>The data network consists of servers, sets of servers, and integrated software applications that allow data to be identified as belonging to the person or animal that presents its tag/RFID transponder.  Therefore, the RFID tag can substantiate
that it belongs to its owner.  This identification process can involve biometric analysis including, but not limited to, picture (photo), retinal/iris scan, fingerprint, and palm vein scanner.  Further identifiers may include DNA/RNA or dental records
that are utilized as non-urgent bio identifiers.  Once an RFID tag is read by the terminal, the terminal downloads additional data from a server and the additional data is presented on a reader terminal's screen.  The RFID tag signal, once sent to the
server network, starts a series of data retrieval and transmission algorithms, some customized by the person or company/business wearing an RFID tag.  Ultimately, data transmission to a fax number, phone number, internet, text or voice file, hospital, or
company, occurs in order to transmit the critical data such as blood type, allergies, or meds for critical injury to a hospital E.R, doctor, or other personnel.
<BR><BR>The RFID tag reader terminal may also interact with other software applications in real time when initiated by tag reading.  This interrogation of the tag by the terminal may include multiple signals if the tag includes multiple RFID chips.  The
terminal may also write to the RFID tag as part of an initiated software application.  In this way, the reader terminal may write important health or bio-identification information to a newly placed RFID tag band.  The newly placed band is incorporated
into a data network.
<BR><BR>This platform provides for immediate presentation of critical data.  It has a particular application for health care urgency delivery for injured people or those in an emergency or disaster situation.  Bio-identification is an important aspect in
ensuring proper use of the critical data.  Preferably, the platform utilizes the RFID tag as an energy-efficient carrier of a health/data record regarding its owner.  Medical/health data, such as medications, are also mission critical and part of the
data presented.
<BR><BR>Referring to FIG. 1, a health care or security personnel employs a reader terminal 1 having a wireless interface.  In this embodiment, the terminal 1 employs an RFID interface to communicate with a transponder 3.  The terminal 1 sends an
energizing signal 20 to the transponder 3 embedded in a silicone wristband 2 that is worn by a person in need of immediate medical attention.  The energizing signal 20, in turn, elicits a return signal 21 from the transponder 3.  The return signal 21
contains data that is read, interpreted and stored in the reader 1.  The data is then available for display on the reader screen 22.  Part of the data retrieved from the transponder 3 is the ID number 21a of the wristband 2.  Software resident in the
reader 1 causes the ID number 21a of the wristband 2 to be transmitted wirelessly 9 to a server 4.  There, the ID number 21a is compared to data contained in a database 5 resident on the server 4.  Once the ID number 21a matches an identical number 26a
in a table 26 (FIG. 8) of the database 5, an image of the wristband owner and/or other verification information, such as additional biometric identifiers, stored in another table 27 (FIG. 8) in the database 5 is sent wirelessly 10 back to the reader 1
where it is available for display.  The image can be compared to the victim to ensure that the wristband wearer is in fact the owner of the wristband 2, and is therefore the person whose critical data has been read by the reader 1.  Subsequent to the
image being transmitted to the reader 1, the database 5 sends additional, supporting medical data 11 to the reader 1 that is stored in the reader 1 and is then available for display on the reader's screen 22.
<BR><BR>The software running on the server 4 next will query 15 the wireless carrier 6 for location data 12 pertaining to the reader 1.  Location data 12 could be provided by GPS or conventional cell tower triangulation methods.  Using the location data
12 provided by the wireless carrier 6 the server 4 would employ a hospital location table 28 in the server database 5 and compare the reader location data 12 to a resident listing of hospital locations and would proceed to transmit 7 either wirelessly,
through the internet or via telephone, for example, the critical medical data 13 of the wristband wearer to hospitals 16 near to the location of the wristband wearer and the assisting health care worker.  The critical medical data 13 would therefore be
available immediately to the hospital staff should the wristband wearer be transported to their hospital.
<BR><BR>Additionally, the server could send alert information 14 to other firms 17 or individuals 8 contained in the wristband wearer's data record.  These firms or individuals could be other family members, other physicians, or the wristband wearer's
employer.  Information can also be transmitted to via robotic voice to a radio 19 or telephone 18.  In all cases, alert information 14 could be procured from the server by those with proper clearance.
<BR><BR>Referring to FIG. 2, the RFID reader 1 sends a signal 20 to the transponder 3 in the wristband 2, thereby exciting the antenna in the transponder 3 and causing the transponder 3 to transmit a signal 21 back to the reader 1.  The signal 21
contains the wristband owner's ID number 21a and critical medical information 21b.  The reader 1 receives and stores the ID number 21a and the medical data 21b.  In addition to waking up the transponder 3, the signal 20 may also write to the transponder
identification information for use in managing and tracking the wearer through a process, which can be either standardized or ad hoc (e.g., an emergency treatment process developed to handle critical care tailored to the situation).  By adding the
identification information, the wearer can be accurately tracked.
<BR><BR>Initially, because current models of transponders have limited memory capacity to store this critical data, it will be necessary to highly encode the data to consume as little memory space as possible.  As technology improves, eventually all of
the critical and personal data about the wristband owner could be stored in the transponder 3.  In one embodiment, the critical data stored on the transponder 3 contains the owner identifier 21a, critical medical data 21b, emergency contact data, and
directives (such as DNR, organ donation, or power of attorney) In an embodiment, the transponder 3 also includes verification data, such as biometric identifiers of the wristband's owner (a digital photograph, fingerprint, dental, RNA/DNA records).  The
critical medical data 21b comprises blood type, medicines, allergies and the like.  Software in the reader 1 interprets the received information and displays the information on the reader's screen 22.  In an embodiment, when transponder 3 does not
include verification data, the reader 1 transmits the ID number 21a wirelessly to a server 4 (FIGS. 1, 8) where it is matched to the owner's picture, or other biometric data.  Once the match is made, the server 4 wirelessly transmits the picture or other
biometric data to the reader 1 where it is displayed on the reader's screen 22.  The reader user can then use the picture displayed to confirm the wristband wearer is the wristband owner.  The server 4 also wirelessly sends additional medical data 11
(FIG. 1) to the reader 1 where it is stored for later display on the reader screen 22, such as when called up by using the keypad 23 on the reader 1.
<BR><BR>As seen in FIGS. 3 and 4, the RFID transponder 3 is encased in a flexible silicone wristband 2 that is impervious to weather and water.  As shown in FIGS. 5-7, because the RFID transponder 3 may not be able to withstand the high heat generated by
molten silicone, the wristband 2 is molded with a cavity 25 that is of a size adequate to allow the insertion of the transponder 3.  A plug 24, also manufactured of silicone, is of the exact shape and size as to be able to completely fill the cavity 25
and will be held securely in place with silicone cement.  The plug 24 is put in place and sealed during the manufacturing process.
<BR><BR>Referring to FIG. 8, the server 4 contains the tables that are used by the system database 5.  The wristband owner table 26 contains all of the wristband owner's medical and other personal data.  The identification table 27 contains verification
data, such as visual and other biometric data of the wristband owner, which is used to prove wristband ownership.  The hospital location table 28 is used to locate hospitals within range of the wristband wearer in times of emergency.  In an embodiment,
this portion of the database 5 also contains a list of sites, such as hospitals or service facilities, which provide initial setup and information transfer or updates for the transponder 3.
<BR><BR>Referring to FIG. 9, in one embodiment, the software in the reader 1 need not be running at all times.  Pressing a key on the reader keyboard 23 (FIG. 2) will start the software and prepare it to receive data from the RFID reader's wireless
interface.  Another key on the keyboard will start the RFID transponder reading process by sending 29 the signal 20 (FIG. 2) to the transponder 3.  This signal causes a return signal 21 (FIG. 2) to be sent from the transponder, wherein the signal 21
carries the data stored in the transponder memory, and received 30 by the reader.  If the data received is proper, the software running on the reader receives the data and interprets it (step 31).  If the data is absent or is formatted improperly, the
screen on the reader will display the words "NO SIGNAL" 32 and the reader will immediately place a wireless call 33 to a help center.  Pressing another key would cause the terminal to write to the RFID tag.
<BR><BR>The data interpreted by the reader software will be stored 34 along with the date and time stamp in the reader memory.  Part of the data received from the transponder is the wristband owner's ID number 21a (FIG. 2).  This number is transmitted 35
wirelessly to a server 4 where database 5 containing information regarding the wristband owner is stored.  At the same time, the critical medical data that was received from the transponder is displayed 36 on the reader screen.
<BR><BR>The ID number 21a (FIG. 2) sent by the reader is compared to a list of ID numbers 26a (FIG. 8) in the database 5.  If there is a match, the picture and/or other biometric data showing proof of wristband ownership is transmitted wirelessly back to
the reader, along with additional medical and personal data.  After the reader receives 37 the biometric data from the server, the wristband owner's picture, and/or other biometric verification data, is displayed 38 on the reader screen.  The reader then
queries the user to match the picture with the wristband wearer, asking if there is a match 39.  If the picture does not match the wearer, the user will indicate so by using the keypad.  At that point, the reader screen displays "USER ID DOES NOT MATCH"
40 and the reader will immediately place a wireless call 41 to a help center.  If the reader user indicates with the keyboard that a match exists, the reader then receives 42 and stores 43 the additional medical and personal data from the server.  The
reader displays 44 the received additional data on the display screen when the reader user inputs a request via the keypad.
<BR><BR>The use of the term "animal" in the following claims is intended to include both humans and lower forms of life.  The use of the term "treatment center" in the following claims is intended to include by way of example, hospitals, field hospitals,
morgues, or any command and control post set up for handling critical information.  Also.  the use of the terms "a" and "an" and "the" and similar referents in the context of describing the invention (especially in the context of the following claims)
