<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>The present invention relates to a method and system used to integrate and control multiple secure credentialing approaches including magnetic stripes, bar codes, contact and contactless SmartCard chips, Short Message Systems (SMS), Global
Positioning Systems (GPS), vicinity type Radio Frequency Identification Devices (RFID), and proximity type RFID, into compact, self-powered, biometrically-protected and enabled devices.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>The invention 10 consists of a Digital Identification Verification Authentication--Personal Identification Device (DIVA-PID 12) and an enrollment system 14 that also enables instant identification and verification through the application of a
single finger or a group of fingers in a pre-arranged order of the device holder and their credentials for selected applications.  The DIVA-PID 12 protects the personal biometric data of the user by utilizing a one-to-few match to release the holder's
credential but not the fingerprint image.
<BR><BR>The released credential enables multi-purpose applications.  The invention is used to capture the results of personal background checks with appropriate authorities to verify and authenticate the status of an individual, transform this data into
an encrypted, secure personal credential, transfer this credential onto the device and subsequently verify the user to the device.
<BR><BR>Only the user can energize the device 12 (i.e., none of the internal systems: memory, processor, communication links and applications can be activated until the device detects the valid fingerprint of the card holder) by a fingerprint driven
biometric system.  Applications of the device include visual and electronic personal identification for access control, financial transactions, loyalty or membership programs, employee identification, passport, VISA, driver's license and government
identification credentials.
<BR><BR>A principle object and advantage is that this invention allows credentialing enrollment authorities, device owners, and point of use applications to establish and define control over the access and transfer of credential and access control
information through unique processes and equipment.
<BR><BR>Another object and advantage of the present invention is that this invention protects individual civil liberties while enabling the positive identification of the owner to the credential management device without the use of external power, human,
or electronic detection means.
<BR><BR>Another object and advantage of the present invention is that the credential management device is visually unidentifiable, inaccessible, and unusable except when energized by the owner.
<BR><BR>Another object and advantage of the present invention is that the invention creates a method for providing secure, private, and efficient access and transaction account control that can interact with an assortment of deployed infrastructures or
new infrastructures including automated teller machines (ATMs), point-of-sale (POS) terminals, SmartCard contact and contactless terminals, radio frequency terminals, short message services (SMS), Global Positioning Systems (GPS), magnetic stripe
readers, and bar code scanners (without the need to validate the user through an independent system the distinction being that the user is authenticated on the card without needing to interface with another system).
<BR><BR>Another object and advantage of the present invention is that the DIVA-PID invention can be manufactured and integrated with (not attached to) small, self-powered form factors such as credit cards, key fobs, pagers, or other similar sized
devices.
<BR><BR>Another object and advantage of the present invention is that the invention is highly secure since the biometric enabling switch can be activated with various "pass codes" created by using multiple fingers in a pattern.  In addition, the release
of credentials is encrypted.
<BR><BR>Another object and advantage of the present invention is that the invention has a unique manufacturing method that uses pressure sensitive printed materials to create the DIVA-PID core functionality in high volumes.  The printed materials allow
for flexibility, reliability and infrastructure capability consistent with or exceeding ISO standards governing credit cards and similar devices.
<BR><BR>Another object and advantage of the present invention is that the invention allows for unique adaptive applications.  Information from interacting with one infrastructure, such as new account credentials obtained via a SmartCard reader connected
to a personal computer can interact with another infrastructure, such as using this new account information during a transaction with an ATM or POS terminal through the magnetic stripe emulation.
<BR><BR>Another principal object and advantage of the present invention is that the invention integrates numerous credential, access control, and credential transfer techniques into a single device enabled and protected by a fingerprint system allowing
the user to self-select the credential or data stored on the device.
<BR><BR>Another object and advantage of the present invention is that the invention integrates flexible glass and/or other substrate materials into the device layers to provide dielectric isolation of circuit layers and components to enable the ISO 7816
standard to be met for thickness and flexibility.
<BR><BR>Another object and advantage of the present invention is that the device can combine the fingerprint biometric with a secondary biometric such as voice recognition to enhance the security of the device, with the secondary biometric integrated as
an integral part of the device.
<BR><BR>Another object and advantage of the present invention is that this invention may make use of Tempest shielding to prevent unauthorized access to electronic systems and data through remote electronic eavesdropping.
<BR><BR>Another object and advantage of the present invention is that this invention may embody decoy circuits to prevent or delay reverse engineering that would penetrate the internal security of the invention and its data.
<BR><BR>Another object and advantage of the present invention is that this invention provides for inter-circuit communication that is internally encrypted to secure the privacy of applications and data (i.e., when data passes from a processor to memory
or visa versa on the device, that data transmission is encrypted).
<BR><BR>Another object and advantage of the present invention is that this invention detects anomalous behavior through on-board applications that either alert the issuer or disable the invention from continuing use (i.e., on-board means on-card and
relies on the internal architecture to allow applications to run on the card).
<BR><BR>Another object and advantage of the present invention is that this invention allows the issuer to instantiate multiple types of <B><I>encryption</I></B> that can be used in any combination to secure applications and data internally and externally (i.e., there
are numerous <B><I>encryption</I></B> methods and this means that they are employable because of the card's internal processor and capability to run user defined applications, such as <B><I>encryption</I></B> methods).
<BR><BR>Another object and advantage of the present invention is that this invention allows for each transmission of data to be uniquely encrypted limiting the effectiveness of eavesdropping on the communication of data and the replication of transmitted
data. <BR><BR>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

<BR><BR>DETAILED SPECIFICATION
<BR><BR>Please refer to FIG. 7:
<BR><BR>Scenario
<BR><BR>Policy makers determine access control rules and credential authority.  Security Authority sets the technology levels required to allow policy: Timers, power management, <B><I>encryption,</I></B> applications to be run, order of processes, communication
channels, communication frequencies, update policies, command center controls, transaction logging, panic modes, display data.  These are programmed into the enrollment station.
<BR><BR>During enrollment, the Enrollment station requests the insertion of a blank Divacard.  The card is tested to detect any interface flaws.  If it is flawed the transaction is terminated and a new card inserted.  The system acknowledges the status
on the workstation screen.
<BR><BR>The policy and applications that drive the card processes are loaded onto the Divacard and stored in memory.
<BR><BR>The enrollment application requests the personnel data from the database.
<BR><BR>The data and the credentials associated with the individual and policy are loaded onto the Divacard.
<BR><BR>Divacard applications encrypt the data and application.
<BR><BR>The Divacard requests a fingerprint to associate with the credential and personnel data.
<BR><BR>The enrollment system passes on the request.
<BR><BR>The user places their finger on the Divacard embedded fingerprint reader.
<BR><BR>The Divacard runs its fingerprint algorithm and encrypts and stores the data on the card.
<BR><BR>The enrollment station may optionally store the fingerprint on a database (policy driven).
<BR><BR>The transaction is logged on the security transaction database.
<BR><BR>The application is terminated.
<BR><BR>Please refer to FIG. 8.
<BR><BR>Scenario
<BR><BR>1 A User activates the card.  Pressing on the finger sensor activates the power.  The initial application is loaded and the fingerprint is delivered to RAM for comparison.
<BR><BR>The application loads the template from stored memory and if the template is successful then the secondary application is requested and loaded.
<BR><BR>On false, the application terminates power.
<BR><BR>In Bimodal Mode the application powers the microphone and requests the voiceprint.  The voiceprint is loaded into RAM and the system requests the user to speak.
<BR><BR>The voice is compared.  On False the application terminates power.  On positive the application loads the credential application.
<BR><BR>The application selects the interface for credential distribution and applies power to each circuit.
<BR><BR>The sensor is transformed to a selector and the microphone is transformed into a selector by the application.
<BR><BR>Selected applications run until the user of the application terminates power.
<BR><BR>2 Remote signals activate the passive RFID and it transmits the unique RFID.
<BR><BR>A separate challenge is required to the user to prove credential ownership.
<BR><BR>3 A page is sent to the card on standby power.
<BR><BR>A firmware application updates the credential against a preassigned code.
<BR><BR>4 Multi app to follow.
<BR><BR>Please reference FIG. 9.
<BR><BR>Scenario
<BR><BR>A user enters a secure zone.
<BR><BR>The card detector identifies the card ID number.
<BR><BR>The detector communicates with the Command Center.
<BR><BR>If the card is not approved then access is denied and condition A is implemented.
<BR><BR>If the card ID is approved, the user is requested to send the credential by matching their fingerprint to the card and releasing the appropriate security data.
<BR><BR>The command system allows access.
<BR><BR>Condition A
<BR><BR>The command center checks policy.
<BR><BR>If the card holder has no updating authority then access is denied.
<BR><BR>If access is denied the policy engine can enforce the shut down of the card, disabling it from further use.
<BR><BR>If the card can be updated the updated credential is sent through the communications network and the card is updated.
<BR><BR>The user represents the credential.
<BR><BR>The transaction and credential databases are updated.
<BR><BR>The form factors for the DIVA-PID 12 come in three general configurations, a credit card like format, a key fob like format, and a pager like format.  Numerous variations of these configurations are possible.  The enrollment station 14 is a
series of integrated devices (see FIG. 1) and software that is configured into numerous configurations to suit the application.  The DIVA-PID 12 and the enrollment station 14 comprise the elements of the credentialing authentication and management
system.
<BR><BR>The Enrollment and Credentialing Control Center
<BR><BR>There are three functions to Enrollment and Credentialing Control:
<BR><BR>DIVA-PID Enrollment Station 14
<BR><BR>Security Control Equipment 16
<BR><BR>Communications Process (not shown)
<BR><BR>DIVA-PID Enrollment Station
<BR><BR>The station 14 is used to create and manage personnel access.  It consists of biometric device interface modules to capture data, networked stations integrating the device with the Security Integration Engine, and a networked station to create
and control personnel enrollment and authorization records.
<BR><BR>Specifically, the DIVA-PID Enrollment Station 14 is used to: Create authorized personnel records.  Capture fingerprint records (if desired or mandated by underlying policy).  Run background checks with appropriate authorities to verify status of
personnel (if desired or mandated by underlying policy).  Program DIVA-PID 12 access devices.  Grant authorizations based upon the unique profile of the holder.  Print and secure DIVA-PID 12 devices and issue each device to an Authenticated individual.
<BR><BR>Security Control Equipment
<BR><BR>The SCS 16 is used to monitor the status of an access control application and make necessary interventions.  The SCS 16 can also be used to modify the general security protocols being used by the system, or the specific protocols being used by
sensors.
<BR><BR>Specifically, the SCS 16 can be used to: Track the location of authorized personnel throughout the control area.  Monitor the alert status of the DIVA-PID 12 and track the location of unauthorized entries in the control area.
<BR><BR>Communications Process
<BR><BR>The communications methodology integrates compatible wireless and non-wireless devices and enables access control to authorized devices only.  The communications process consists of a networked station that integrates secure wireless and
non-wireless voice communication devices.
<BR><BR>Specifically, the communications process is used to: Manage communications with security personnel from the security office, including the transmission of security protocols and changes to alert status.  Control and/or limit access to the
communications network.  Update, add, or remove credential information.
<BR><BR>Typical Enrollment Process (FIG. 8)
<BR><BR>DIVA-PID 12 blanks are delivered to enrollment centers for personalization to the end user, and to have all the appropriate codes, tokens, and credentials added (see FIG. 8).  Prior to issuing a DIVA-PID 12, the enrollment officer will follow the
established policy for card issuance.  A policy will typically involve a background check and a verification of credentials and/or access privileges.  The enrollment officer and the policy mechanisms are responsible for verifying that the applicant has
been positively identified prior to proceeding.  Depending upon the underlying policy, the user will enroll a single finger, or a combination of digits.  The ability to enroll multiple digits means that more than one individual can be enrolled to a
single card.  The DIVA-PID 12 can be set up to activate when it positively identifies any one of the digits now stored in memory or a combination of digits in a specific order to act as additional security.  A certain pattern of fingers could be assigned
to covertly indicate that a user was under duress when authenticating.
<BR><BR>Once the enrollment process is completed the enrollment circuitry is disabled by electronic means so that only the enrollment office can enroll or re-enroll a user.  If the policy allowed, the DIVA-PID 12 could be set up to allow the addition or
removal of credentials through the RFID.  At the time of enrollment:
<BR><BR>DIVA-PID 12 can employ <B><I>encryption</I></B> and digitally secure transfer mechanisms.
<BR><BR>The DIVA-PID 12 can be used for every secure card need from access control to credit card protection.
<BR><BR>Each DIVA-PID 12 has the ability to store multiple credentials, such as a drivers license, passport, building access, credit card, health care card, etc.
<BR><BR>Unless authenticated, the DIVA-PID 12 remains in the "deep sleep" default mode, but can be "seen" once the DIVA-PID 12 is within the read range of the RFID network.  This is due to DIVA-PID 12's on-board RFID being in the semi-active RFID mode
while the card is in deep sleep.  Only when the DIVA-PID 12 is turned on by an authenticated holder can the card functions be activated.
<BR><BR>Enrollment Center Equipment Description
<BR><BR>Enrollment Center Digital Camera

<BR><BR>Enrollment Center DIVA-PID Blanks
<BR><BR>DIVA-PID 12s, available in all three configurations are delivered to authorized enrollment centers to be matched to users and activated.
<BR><BR>DIVA-PID 12 Typical Form Factors
<BR><BR>(a) The Credit Card like configuration
<BR><BR>The DIVAcard 12 format 12a is generally designed to have a form factor (see FIGS. 2a, 2b and 3) that conforms with the physical requirements of standard magnetic strip cards and smart cards, as specified in International Standards Organization
("ISO") standards ISO 7811 and ISO 7816 with the exception of flexibility and that the thickness will likely range from 0.78 to 5.0 millimeters depending on the application and features.
<BR><BR>The invention 10 includes a biometric sensor 30 coupled with control circuitry (not shown), microprocessor 32, memory 34 and an on-board power source 36.  An alphanumeric display 38, tone generator 40, and LEDs 42 are provided for interacting
with the user.  A visual display area 44 with either an active display or a printable area is provided with multiple means of securely interacting with the user and with existing infrastructure, including: a magnetic stripe emulator 45 for interacting
with magnetic stripe readers in ATMs or POS devices; a smart card contact pad 46 in the 0.78 mm thick configuration; and an embedded antenna 48 for interacting with a number of electromagnetic devices, including contact-less smart card readers, SMS, GPS,
and radio frequency identification devices (RFIDs).  The alphanumeric display 38 is also capable of interacting with infrared bar code scanners by displaying a bar code similar to a Universal Product Code used on most consumer goods or of the type used
to identify a customer's loyalty or member account number, such as those used at a retail store.  The on-board power source may include a rechargeable battery, a non-rechargeable battery, or some combination of these devices.  For an exploded view of the
layers making up the core functions of the DIVAcard, see FIG. 4.
<BR><BR>(b) The Key Fob Like Configuration (FIGS. 3 and 4)
<BR><BR>The DIVAkey Fob 12, 12b includes the following components: a biometric sensor 30 coupled with control circuitry (not shown) and memory 34, an on-board power source 36, a means of interacting with the user, such as an alphanumeric display device
38, and various means of securely interacting with existing infrastructure, such as through a magnetic stripe emulator 45 for interacting with magnetic stripe readers in ATMs or POS devices, an antenna 48 for interacting with any of a number of
electromagnetic device terminals, such as contact-less smart card readers or other radio frequency devices.
<BR><BR>In one variation a Universal Serial Bus (USB) plug 50 is included for interaction with a USB port of a typical personal computer.  The power source 36 includes a rechargeable battery, a non-rechargeable battery, or some combination of these power
sources.  In one variation, the display 38 is capable of interacting with bar code scanners, such as standard infrared bar code scanners used at the checkout lanes of retail stores by displaying a bar code similar to a Universal Product Code used on most
consumer goods or of the type used to identify a customer's loyalty or member account number, such as those used at a retail store.
<BR><BR>In this form factor, the magnetic stripe emulator 45 does not work in so-called capture magnetic stripe readers of the type found in ATMs and gas pumps, but does work in most swipe-style POS terminals where the magnetic stripe is swiped through a
slot that contains the magnetic stripe read head.
<BR><BR>(c) The Pager Like Configuration (FIGS. 3, 5a, 5b, 5c)
<BR><BR>The DIVApager 12, 12c includes the following components: a biometric sensor 30 coupled with control circuitry (not shown) and memory 34, an on-board power source 36, a means of interacting with the user, such as an alphanumeric display 38 and a
visual display area 44, and various means of securely interacting with existing infrastructure, such as through a magnetic stripe emulator 45 for interacting with magnetic stripe readers in ATMs or POS devices, an antenna 48 for interacting with any of a
number of electromagnetic device terminals, such as contact-less smart card readers or other radio frequency devices.
<BR><BR>In one variation (not shown) a Universal Serial Bus (USB) plug is included for interaction with a USB port of a typical personal computer.  The power source 36 is a standard cell phone rechargeable battery.  In one variation, the display 38 is
capable of interacting with bar code scanners, such as standard infrared bar code scanners used at the checkout lanes of retail stores, by displaying a bar code similar to a Universal Product Code used on most consumer goods or of the type used to
identify a customer's loyalty or member account number, such as those used at a retail store.
<BR><BR>In one variation (not shown), an audio tone generator and LEDs are included to assist in the interaction with the user.
<BR><BR>In this DIVApager form factor, the magnetic stripe emulator 45 flips out from the side of the case and does not work in so-called capture magnetic stripe readers of the type found in ATMs and gas pumps, but does work in most swipe-style POS
terminals where the magnetic stripe is swiped through a slot that contains the magnetic stripe read head.
<BR><BR>The DIVA-PID Manufacturing Approach (FIG. 6)
<BR><BR>The core functionality integrated by the DIVA-PID 12 device utilizes a unique manufacturing process developed for the pressure sensitive materials industry to build up printed layers of functional devices at high machine speed feeds (see FIG. 10)
utilizing flexible glass, glass epoxy or polyimide substrates.
<BR><BR>Pressure Sensitive Adhesive Layers Using Flexible Substrates
<BR><BR>The core functions are partitioned on up to three layers of adhesive material that are combined to form a single flexible assembly for the DIVAcard and the DIVApager formats.  The preferred substrate material is a thin woven fiberglass sheet that
is vacuum impregnated with a solvent-less resin technology.  This material is very stable thermally and mechanically with excellent dielectric properties.  The individual layers can be applied to a roller and configured in a machine to be rolled out with
the other layers to make the finished assembly.  An adhesive is applied during the process to permanently bind the layers.
<BR><BR>The DIVAkey will use the same manufacturing technique but will have different layers to fit into the irregular case.
<BR><BR>SmartCard Contact/Contactless Chip
<BR><BR>The DIVA-PID 12 may include a contact-less SmartCard device and can interact with standard SmartCard readers of the type that are typically connected to merchant terminals and standard computers, as described in the ISO 7816 specification such as
a Datakey Model 330.  The DIVAcard also has a SmartCard contact terminal pad 46.  There are a number of interactions for which standard smart cards are used, including building access, computer access, network access, electronic financial purses, long
distance telephone calls at pay phones, mobile phone network access and mobile phone account numbers or purses.  The interaction begins with a personalized DIVA-PID 12 with at least one previously initialized credit or debit account number.  The
fingerprint template of the authorized user and the initialized account numbers are stored in the non-volatile memory of the device.  The process includes three principle steps: enabling the device, selecting an account, and enabling the SmartChip.
<BR><BR>Magnetic Stripe Emulation
<BR><BR>The DIVA-PID magnetic stripe emulation processes include an account initialization process and an emulation process at an ATM or at the point of sale.  The magnetic stripe of common identification cards are specified by the American National
Standards Institute (ANSI), such as in ANSI standard X4.16-1983, and by the more recent international standard for identification cards provided in ANSI/ISO/IEC-7811 Parts 1-5.  The typical process for any of the devices described herein with a magnetic
stripe emulator is the use of the magnetic stripe emulation at a POS terminal or, at an ATM for the purpose of transmitting to the magnetic stripe reader a credit or debit account number.  The magnetic strip is part of the internal circuit of the
Divacard and operates only after the user authenticates himself/herself to the device.  In addition, the function of the card allows multiple accounts to be accessed via the conversion of the fingerprint sensor into a track pad.
<BR><BR>The interaction begins with a personalized device with at least one previously initialized credit or debit account number.  The fingerprint template of the authorized user and the initialized account numbers are stored in the non-volatile memory
of the device.  The process includes three principle steps: enabling the device, selecting an account, and emulation of the magnetic stripe.
<BR><BR>Magnetic stripe emulators are generally known.  See, for example, U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,206,293, No. 5,834,747, and No. 4,791,283.  Our invention does not attempt to reproduce the entire magnetic stripe but instead electronically couples a portion of
the needed code written on the magnetic stripe track at the enrollment process.  In this manner the power requirements are minimal and the magnetic stripe is unreadable until turned on by the authenticated device holder.
<BR><BR>Biometric Control System
<BR><BR>The invention 10 can incorporate fingerprint sensor technologies 30a of three available types, pressure, optical, and ultrasonic.  It currently focuses on the pressure type from Fidelica Corp.  primarily due to size, cost and the ease of
manufacture on thin film materials.  In addition, the pressure type sensor 30a can be used as a selector switch thus eliminating the need for additional devices.  The fingerprint sensor 30a acts as an intelligent on-off switch for all function
incorporated into the DIVA-PID 12.  During the enrollment process, the owner of the DIVA-PID 12 may enroll any finger or thumb and multiple additional digits to activate the device.  For more secure applications the enrollment process can require a
number of fingers to be entered in a specific order, thereby making it more difficult to counterfeit.  Once the fingerprint enrollment process is completed, the templates are stored in memory and the enrollment process is electronically permanently
destroyed so no tampering with the authentication process can occur.  The software algorithm used to match the results has a "single touch" false acceptance rate (FAR) of 0.001% and false rejection rate (FRR) of 0.08%, and is based on the leading
forensic fingerprint algorithm developed by BioScrypt.
<BR><BR>The interaction begins with the fingerprint template(s) of the authorized user that is stored in the non-volatile memory of the device by the authorized enrollment officer.  The process includes four principle configurations: unauthenticated,
authenticated, failed authentication, and authenticated "under duress."
<BR><BR>RFID System
<BR><BR>The RFID antennas 48 and chips support operating frequencies from 800 MHz to 2.45 GHz and are of the transceiver type operating in semi-active and active modes.  The initial configurations utilize IEEE 802.15.4/Zigbee protocols in a Chipcon
cc2420 (see FIG. 14).  Once the biometric sensor 30 is activated by the authorized user, the RFID circuit can be selected to operate in the active mode.  The semi-active mode allows the device to be detected by vicinity and proximity readers to alert the
reader that the device is within a control area, but has not yet been authenticated to pass sensitive credential information.  This feature is important in access control applications as a detection and tracking tool.  The read/write capability allows
credentials to be electronically updated, added, or removed by authorized enrollment agents.
<BR><BR>The interaction begins with a personalized device with at least one stored credential.  The fingerprint template of the authorized user and the active and semi-active credentials are stored in the non-volatile memory of the device.  The device,
even in "deep sleep" mode, is always in the semi-active mode so it can detect or be detected by a RF reader.  Once the device is detected, the reader can activate the device's tone generator 40 or LED 42 to indicate that the user should attempt to
authenticate the device.  Once authenticated, one or more credentials are transmitted, or other functions on the card are activated to interact with the reader.
<BR><BR>Barcode
<BR><BR>The bar codes displayed by the devices described herein are dynamically rendered on the alphanumeric display 38 that can be read by standard bar code scanners.  Further, the user is able to select from a number of bar codes stored in the device. 
Further, the display device can be directed to remove the image of the bar code from the display so that the bar code cannot be scanned until the user again selects the bar code to be displayed and potentially re-verifies his identity through biometric
input.  This invention 10 can be used to display membership account numbers of the type used by retail and grocery stores, as well as membership numbers used by membership clubs, such as country clubs and fitness clubs.
<BR><BR>The interaction begins with a personalized device with at least one stored credential.  The fingerprint template of the authorized user and the bar code information is stored in the non-volatile memory of the device.  Once the user authenticates
the card the finger platen 30a can be used as a mouse to index through the functions displayed on the LCD until the Bar code function is selected.  The bar code can then be scanned.
<BR><BR>Alphanumeric Display
<BR><BR>The Basic Display card includes all of the devices listed in the Secure Multi-access Display card, with a small display 38 that displays alphanumeric text, graphics, and bar codes.  The small display uses 1 to 2 lines and up to 20 characters.  A
special film material is applied over the display in manufacturing to allow the LCD or other display type to emulate bar codes readable by standard bar code scanners.
<BR><BR>The interaction begins with a personalized device with at least one stored credential.
<BR><BR>The fingerprint template of the authorized user is stored in the non-volatile memory of the device.  Once the user authenticates the card, the finger platen 30a can be used to index through the functions displayed on the LCD or other display type
until the desired function is selected and becomes active for a predetermined period of time.
<BR><BR>Active Display
<BR><BR>An optional configuration provides for an active display 44 that has sufficient resolution to produce tables of information and graphical images.  Information can be stored in memory or dynamically written to the card through the RF interface. 
Once the image is written there is no need to keep power applied to the display to retain the image, thereby saving battery power.
<BR><BR>In one use of this display, a table includes immigration and visa information of the authorized user.  In another use, the display shows information typically found on a driver's license.  However, the device is not limited to storing a single
display as the biometric sensor pad permits input from the user that includes the ability of selecting and displaying multiple pages of information.
<BR><BR>By way of example, a single device could store and display data for various purposes, such as passport control, driver's license information, border control authorization, building and computer network access control, financial account and
balance information, credit/debit card authorization, and healthcare information.
<BR><BR>Control Electronics and Operational Software
<BR><BR>The control electronics tie all functions of the card together and control their operation including power management and battery charging.  Application Specific Integrated Circuits and discrete devices are used in conjunction with memory
devices, operational software, and <B><I>encryption</I></B> techniques to complete the total control of the DIVA-PID configurations.
<BR><BR>No function can be executed unless first enabled by a successful fingerprint match except for the limited information available in the RFID semi-active mode.
<BR><BR>Power Generation
<BR><BR>Power generation is achieved by a combination of traditional thin-film deposition technologies and high energy density such as lithium polymer to create rechargeable battery technology that is integrated directly into the thin film layers of the
functional elements being manufactured.  The DIVAkey 12b and DIVApager 12c will use standard battery technology for electronic devices because more space is available.  The battery is used in a pulsed mode to maximize the time between charges.
<BR><BR>Short Messaging Service
<BR><BR>The optional SMS Circuitry (not shown) can send and receive messages using the same deployed infrastructure as is used by existing two-way pagers.
<BR><BR>The interaction begins with a personalized device with at least one stored credential.  The fingerprint template of the authorized user is stored in the non-volatile memory of the device.  Once the DIVA-PID 12 comes within range of a reader, the
reader can send the user a signal to authenticate in order to receive a message.  Once the user authenticates the card, the finger platen can be used to index through the functions displayed on the LCD until the desired SMS function is selected and
becomes active for a predetermined period of time.
<BR><BR>Global Positioning System
<BR><BR>The optional GPS receiving circuitry (not shown) can be queried by the microprocessor to determine the global position of the device.
<BR><BR>The interaction begins with a personalized device with at least one stored credential.  The fingerprint template of the authorized user is stored in the non-volatile memory of the device.  The DIVA-PID 12 can be set up to transmit a periodic GPS
protocol format to a reader or it can be queried by an RF reader and the user can determine if they want to transmit a signal to identify their location.
<BR><BR>Manner and Process of Using the Invention
<BR><BR>The DIVA-PIDs fingerprint platen 30a is activated upon touch, which switches on the electronics and initiates a comparison of the current fingerprint(s) with the onboard fingerprint(s).  If the print matches one of the stored prints or the
correct pattern of stored prints, then the card is enabled; if not, it shuts down so that no data can be transmitted by the device.  Once activated, the platen 30a can be used as a select/scroll touch sensitive control pad.
<BR><BR>Because the card will be handed to third parties (e.g., a merchant) for many of the transactions, a timer can be programmed to keep the card open for a fixed period (e.g., fifteen seconds to two minutes) so that the card can go through its
authorization and update processes.  After the time expires, the card shuts down until biometrically activated again.
<BR><BR>Expiration dates can be set to shut down the card at a fixed time.  The card can be addressed by authorized enrollment agents to remotely remove or update credential data.  The card has a variety of optional ways of interacting with the
infrastructure.  Magnetic Stripe Emulation interacts with standard magnetic stripe readers.  A SmartCard contact pad is used to interact with SmartCard contact readers.  An antenna provides interactions with contact-less read/write devices and may
interact with common transponder technology such as EZ-Pass and SpeedPass.
<BR><BR>In addition, card queries and detection can be managed from distances of up to 300 feet, depending on power and data transmission speed requirements.
<BR><BR>A significant advantage of the DIVA-PID 12, in addition to biometric security, is the magnetic stripe emulation capability that allows current magnetic stripe readers, the least expensive and most ubiquitous credit card reading devices, to
interact with the DIVA-PID 12.  Most credit card and access control infrastructure is based on magnetic stripe readers.
<BR><BR>The inventors have developed a method for sending a signal to the magnetic stripe area 45 of the card to "unlock" the magnetic card stripe.  The major difference is that, unlike current magnetic stripe technology, the magnetic stripe cannot be
read unless the device is switched on by the authenticated holder.  This greatly enhances the security of this most basic technology.
<BR><BR>Another security risk, the embossed number, can be overcome by replacing the embossed number with a digital display that is only activated by the verified user.  As a by-product of this function, multiple card accounts, reward programs, coupons,
access rules, credentials, special applications and other digital real estate can be viewed and used.  Notwithstanding brand and issuer rules, a single card could contain issuing bank account information, as well as account numbers for VISA, MasterCard,
American Express, or any other desired debit/credit payment system.

<BR><BR>Personalization Process
<BR><BR>Before any of the DIVA-PID 12 devices described herein can be used to conduct transactions on behalf of a particular user, the device must be personalized to the owner.  For example, the owner must register his fingerprint with the device through
the biometric fingerprint platen 30a.  After the personalization step, that individual becomes the authorized user of a particular device.  For the devices with a display 44, the authorization process can be facilitated through graphical prompts in the
display.  For secure credentials, the enrollment and credentialing systems must be used.  However there are numerous applications where the owner can download information from the Internet directly onto the DIVA-PID 12 through the smart chip pad and a
PCMCIA card without the need for the enrollment system 14.  For example, coupons, specials, or loyalty programs a company may wish to offer DIVA-PID owners.
<BR><BR>Initialization Process
<BR><BR>Once a DIVA-PID 12 has been personalized, it may be initialized with data, such as account information related to a particular credit account through the enrollment and credential management system.
<BR><BR>The basic steps in the remote initialization process are: Enabling the device by an authorized owner Establishing a secure connection to an authorized initializing institution so that particular information can be downloaded to the biometric
device Verifying the right of the user to access the sought after information, and downloading the information to the biometric device.  Credentials can also be downloaded by authorized reader stations at various locations.  See FIG. 8, which details the
systems view of the initialization and management process.
<BR><BR>Enabling Processes
<BR><BR>8 Card Activation:
<BR><BR>Scenario: 1.  A user activates the card, pressing on the finger sensor and activates the power; the initial application is loaded and the fingerprint is delivered to RAM for comparison.  The application loads the template from stored memory, and,
if the template is successful, then the secondary application is requested and loaded.  On false, the application terminates power in Bimodal Mode; the application powers the microphone and requests the voiceprint.  The voiceprint is loaded into RAM, and
the system requests the user to speak.  The voice is compared on False; the application terminates power.  On positive, the application loads the credential application.  The application selects the interface for credential distribution and applies power
to each circuit.  Then sensor is transformed to a selector, and the microphone is transformed to a selector by the application.  Selected applications run until the user or the application terminates power.  2.  Remote signals activate the passive RFID,
and it transmits its unique RFID.  A separate challenge is required for the user to prove credential ownership.  3.  A page is sent to the card on standby power.  A firmware application updates the credential against a preassigned code.  4.  Multi-app to
follow.  7 Card Enrollment:
<BR><BR>Scenario: Policymakers determine access control rules and credential authority.  Security authority sets the technology levels required to allow policy, timers, power management, <B><I>encryption,</I></B> applications to be run, order of processes,
communication channels, communication frequencies, update policies, command center controls, transaction logging, panic modes, display data.  These are programmed into the enrollment work station.  During enrollment, the enrollment station requests the
insertion of a blank Divacard.  The card is tested to detect any interface flaws.  If it is flawed, the transaction is terminated and a new card inserted.  The system acknowledges the status on the work station screen.  The policy and applications that
drive the card processes are loaded onto the Divacard and stored in memory.  The enrollment application requests the personnel data from the database.  The data and the credentials associated with the individual and policy are loaded onto the Divacard. 
Divacard applications encrypt the data and application.  The Divacard requests a fingerprint to associate with the credential and personnel data.  The enrollment system passes on the request.  The user places their finger on the Divacard embedded
fingerprint reader.  The Divacard runs its fingerprint algorithm and encrypts and stores that data on the card.  The enrollment station may optionally store the fingerprint on a database (policy driven).  The transaction is logged on the security
transaction database.  The application is terminated.  9 Security Control:
<BR><BR>Scenario: A user enters a secure zone.  The card detector identifies the card ID number.  The detector communicates with the Command Center.  If the card is not approved, then access is denied and Condition A is implemented.  If the card ID is
approved, the user is requested to send the credential by matching their fingerprint to the card and releasing the appropriate security data.  The command system allows access.
<BR><BR>Condition A: The command center checks policy; if the cardholder has no updating authority, then access is denied.  If access is denied, the policy engine can enforce the shutdown of the card, disabling it from further use.  If the card can be
updated, the updated credential is sent through the communications network, and the card is updated.  The user represents the credential.  The transaction and credential databases are updated.
<BR><BR>Once a DIVA-PID 12 that has been initialized with the necessary information associated with the authorized user, the enabling process will verify that that individual is an authorized user of the device.
<BR><BR>The enabling process must be successfully performed before the device will transmit any personal data to any outside device.  The enabling process is the same for all of the biometric devices.  Where the biometric device 30 includes a fingerprint
sensor 30a, the biometric device 30 is enabled by the authorized user by the placement of the user's enrolled finger, or fingers in a series, on the fingerprint platen 30a.  The fingerprint platen 30a recognizes the placement of the finger and begins the
scan of the finger to determine the fingerprint, reducing the fingerprint to a template of minutiae as is common in the art.  This minutiae template is compared with a previously stored fingerprint minutiae template and a calculation is made as to the
degree of match between the two templates.  If the match meets pre-established criteria, then the match is verified and the biometric device converts to an enabled state.
<BR><BR>The enabling step takes less than two seconds.
<BR><BR>Consistent with the concepts of the invention 10, sufficient power is included in the devices such that the enabling process can occur without the aid of any other device.  This step is crucial to enabling the biometric device 30 to transact with
other systems, such as a magnetic stripe reader, a contact or contact-less smart card reader, a radio frequency device, or a bar code scanner.
<BR><BR>Consistent with the invention 10 herein, each device includes a display or an audio tone generator, or some combination thereof, which separately or together aid the authorized user of the device through the enabling process by providing prompts
on the display or generating one or more tones or tone sequences, or some combination of these prompts and feedbacks.  Once enabled, the device may stay enabled until, for example, a predetermined time period has elapsed or for a predetermined number of
uses.  Once the device is in an enabled state, the device is ready for the account selection step.  For the devices described herein with active displays 44, the display may show the account number used during the last transaction, or some graphic or
text that identifies the account number to the user such as either an institution name, credit organization name or icon.
<BR><BR>The owner uses the finger platen 30a to index through the type of transaction he wishes to perform.  If the account that the user wants to use for the given transaction is the same as the account used on the previous transaction, then this step
is complete.  Once the desired account has been selected, the user again places their finger on the fingerprint platen 30a to confirm the new account selection, ending the account selection step.  Once the authorized user selects the desired account on
an enabled device, the user either hands the DIVA-PID 12 to the store clerk for the clerk to swipe or insert in a magnetic stripe reader, or swipes/inserts the device himself.
<BR><BR>Disabling Process
<BR><BR>Consistent with the invention 10 described herein, select account information or all of the information on a secure device is subject to being removed by an authorized central service using SMS or a similar wireless messaging service.  The
disabling instructions are communicated in an encrypted manner by an authorized central service.  The disabling instruction is called for when a user is no longer authorized to use a particular account or when the user reports the device as missing or
stolen.
<BR><BR>BEST MODE CONTEMPLATED FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>The business processes that are enabled by the integrated biometric devices are in the areas, among others, of financial transactions, information security transactions, physical access control, identification, device access control, loyalty
program transactions, immigration and border control, travel identification, coupon solicitation and coupon redemption processes.
<BR><BR>One of the novelties of the new invention is that information from interacting with one infrastructure, such as new account information obtained via a smart card reader connected to a personal computer, can subsequently be used during
interactions with another infrastructure, such as making use of this new account information during a transaction with an ATM or POS terminal through the magnetic stripe emulation.
<BR><BR>Immigration Process
<BR><BR>In one variation of the DIVA-PID 12, some of the pages of information that can be displayed contain the same information that is on a standard passport, including type of passport, passport number, surname, given name, nationality, date and place
of birth, sex, and date of issue of the passport, expiration date of the passport, authority, and image of the passport holder.  In this variation, another page that can be selected contains information related to entering and leaving a country.
<BR><BR>Driver's License Process
<BR><BR>In one variation of the DIVA-PID 12 with the large display 44, some of the pages of information that can be displayed contains the same information that is on a state-issued driver's license, including licensing state, driver's license number,
driver's name, current address, date of birth, sex, weight, height, eye color, an image of the driver, and additional information as required by the issuing state.
<BR><BR>Travel Process
<BR><BR>In one variation of the devices described herein, the device can be used during the travel process to validate that the user holding the device is the authorized user.  This information can then be used to streamline the security clearance
processes in place to screen passengers before they are authorized to board commercial transport, such as a ship, airline, bus or train.
<BR><BR>Multi-Pass Process
<BR><BR>There are several existing infrastructures presently deployed that make use of the ability to transmit an identification number over a radio frequency as a means of initiating a transaction with a subscribed patron.  This radio frequency
identification (RFID) process is used by drivers of vehicles to pay tolls at the tollbooths of toll roads and toll bridges, by drivers at gas pumps to pay for gasoline, and by patrons of convenience stores and restaurants to pay for goods and services. 
In the current art, each of the organizations that deploys RFID infrastructure for the purpose of accepting payment also gives to each of their customers that subscribe to the RFID payment service a physical token that responds with a preset RFID number.
<BR><BR>Consistent with the invention 10 described herein, some variations of the DIVA-PID 12 devices can interact with one or more of these existing RFID payment infrastructures.  After successfully initializing a device with one or more authorized
subscriber RFID numbers, the authorized user of the device can enable the device, select the desired RFID account, and interact with the RFID payment infrastructure.
<BR><BR>Coupon Selection Process
<BR><BR>Consistent with the invention 10 described herein, some variations of the DIVA-PID 12's can interact with computer applications and with devices at a retail store where store-issued or manufacturer-issued coupons are accepted.  The device can
interact with a computer application to download electronic versions of coupons offered to the device user by the store, a manufacturer, or a third party organization acting on the behalf of the coupon issuing entity.  The UPC code, codes, or code
pattern for the product or products associated with the coupon offer and the amount of the discount are downloaded into non-volatile memory of the device.
<BR><BR>In the variations of the devices that include the ability to interact through radio frequencies (RF capable devices), the devices can be activated at the entrances of participating retail stores and can provide an audible or visible prompt to the
device user that coupons are available to that user for selection.  In this variation, the user can then interact with the device to view the coupons that are being offered for products being carried by the retail store that has just been entered, and
can select to accept one or more coupons for use in the near future.  In one variation, the expiration time of the selected offers is selectable by the coupon issuer.
<BR><BR>In some variation of the RF capable devices, the device can interact with an electronic coupon-dispensing device located on the store shelf near the product.  When the user device is within a pre-selected distance (for example, ten feet or less),
the shelf device can alert the shopper that a coupon is available for selection by flashing a light on the shelf unit and/or showing a prompt on a display attached to or part of the shelf unit.
<BR><BR>In at least one variation, the shelf unit contains information on a default value of the coupon available for selection.  In another variation, the shelf unit receives a value for the coupon from the user device.  This step permits the coupon
issuer the ability to offer a coupon to a device user that is different from the default value, with the specific user's coupon value having been previously selected during the coupon download process.  In turn this personalized coupon value can then be
displayed at the shelf unit for viewing by the device user.
<BR><BR>Coupon Redemption Process
<BR><BR>Consistent with the invention 10 described herein, the selected coupons are redeemed through a process at the checkout lane of the retail store.  There is a device at the checkout lane that interacts with the user device, (the "Check-out Device")
using any of the means supported by the user device.  The Check-out Device also interacts with the store register.  In the traditional process of coupon redemption, the shopper pays a discounted price and the store receives a printed coupon that it
submits to the coupon issuer or a third-party coupon redemption aggregator for payment of the face value of the coupon plus a handling fee.  In the process described here, however, the store receives full payment for the goods or services.  The store
register transmits the transaction log to the check-out Device.  In one variation, the Check-out Device then obtains from the user device the selected coupons and transmits the transaction log, the selected coupons, and the user identification
information to a central electronic coupon redemption service.
<BR><BR>In an alternate variation, the Check-out Device transmits the transaction log to the user device and the user device transmits the transaction log, the selected coupons, and user identification information to a central coupon redemption service. 
In both variations, the transmission of the information to the central service may occur some time after the check-out process has concluded, such as during the night.
<BR><BR>In the variation that the user device transmits the information, the user device uses the SMS network used by two-way pagers to transmit the information to the central service.  In all variations, the store receives full payment for the goods or
services purchased, including the products or services for which the user has selected coupons.  The redeemed funds from the coupon issuer for the face value of the coupons plus handling or transaction fees are then credited to the user's account.  In
one variation some of the handling fee is shared with the store.  In another variation, the store receives a transaction log transfer fee for any transaction log that includes at the least, one coupon redemption.  At the time of purchase, the user device
either calculates the total coupon savings that is earmarked to be credited to the user's account, or receives the total coupon savings amount from the central service via SMS messaging or similar wireless messaging service.  After the coupons have been
redeemed from the coupon issuer and the funds received by the central coupon redemption service, the appropriate earmarked funds are then credited to the user's account.  On the devices with displays and wireless messaging service, the user can view the
value of the coupon redemption account directly through the display on the secure device.  These funds may be used directly through use of the device when the user selects the account to be used during a financial transaction, similar to the traditional
use of a credit or debit card.
<BR><BR>Transaction Log Processes
<BR><BR>Consistent with the invention 10 described herein, the transaction logs obtained from the DIVA-PID 12 devices during the coupon redemption process are retained by a central service.  The user can view their transaction logs and these logs are
used as input into various algorithms that permits the user to examine their previous buying patterns and their use of coupons and coupon savings.  Additionally, the transaction logs are used to assist in the preparation of a shopping list for the user.
<BR><BR>In one variation of this process, the user selects coupons to be redeemed after successful transmission of the shopping list to a participating store and the store prepares the goods for pick-up or delivery.
